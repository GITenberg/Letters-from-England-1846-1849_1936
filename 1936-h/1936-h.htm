<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth Davis Bancroft</span>, the
writer of these letters, was the youngest child and only daughter
of William and Rebecca Morton Davis, and was born at Plymouth,
Mass., in October, 1803.&nbsp; She often spoke in later times of
what a good preparation for her life abroad were the years she
spent at Miss Cushing&rsquo;s school at Hingham, and of her
visits to her uncles, Judge Davis and Mr. I. P. Davis of
Boston.&nbsp; In 1825 she married Alexander Bliss, a brilliant
young lawyer and a junior partner of Daniel Webster.&nbsp; On his
death a few years later, her father having died, her mother and
brother formed a household with her and her two sons in Winthrop
Place, Boston.&nbsp; As a young girl in Plymouth she became a
great friend of the future Mrs. Emerson and later of Mr. Emerson
and of Mr. and Mrs. Ripley, and through them was much interested
in Brook Farm.</p>
<p>In 1838 she married George Bancroft, the historian and
statesman, who was then Collector of the Port of Boston and a
widower with three children.&nbsp; They continued to live in
Winthrop Place till 1845, when for one year Mr. Bancroft was
Secretary of the Navy in Polk&rsquo;s cabinet.&nbsp; While he was
in that position the Naval Academy at Annapolis was established;
and he played an important part in the earlier stages of the
Mexican War.&nbsp; In the fall of 1846 he became Minister to
England.&nbsp; It was then that the letters were written from
which these extracts have been taken.&nbsp; A number of passages
not of general interest have been omitted, without any
indications of such omission in the text, but in no case has any
change in a sentence been made.&nbsp; Most of the letters are in
the form of a diary and were addressed to immediate relatives,
and none of them were written for publication; but owing to the
standing of Mr. Bancroft as a man of letters, as well as his
official station, the writer saw London life under an unusual
variety of interesting aspects.</p>
<p>In 1849 Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft returned to this country, and
Mr. Bancroft occupied himself with his history until 1868, when
he was for seven years Minister to Prussia and the German
Empire.&nbsp; At the expiration of that time they took up their
residence in Washington, where they lived during the remainder of
their lives.</p>

<h2>Letters from England</h2>
<h3><i>To W. D. B. and A. B.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Liverpool</span>, October 26, 1846.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sons</span>: Thank God with me
that we are once more on <i>terra firma</i>.&nbsp; We arrived
yesterday morning at ten o&rsquo;clock, after a very rough voyage
and after riding all night in the Channel in a tremendous gale,
so bad that no pilot could reach us to bring us in on Saturday
evening.&nbsp; A record of a sea voyage will be only interesting
to you who love me, but I must give it to you that you may know
what to expect if you ever undertake it; but first, I must sum it
all up by saying that of all horrors, of all physical miseries,
tortures, and distresses, a sea voyage is the greatest . . . The
Liverpool paper this morning, after announcing our arrival says:
&ldquo;The <i>Great Western</i>, notwithstanding she encountered
throughout a series of most severe gales, accomplished the
passage in sixteen days and twelve hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To begin at the moment I left New York: I was so absorbed by
the pain of parting from you that I was in a state of complete
apathy with regard to all about me.&nbsp; I did not
sentimentalize about &ldquo;the receding shores of my
country;&rdquo; I hardly looked at them, indeed.&nbsp; Friday I
was awoke in the middle of the night by the roaring of the wind
and sea and <i>such</i> motion of the vessel.</p>
<p>The gale lasted all Saturday and Sunday, strong from the
North, and as we were in the region where the waters of the Bay
of Fundy run out and meet those of the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
afterwards we had a strong cross sea.&nbsp; May you never
experience a &ldquo;cross sea.&rdquo; . . . Oh how I wished it
had pleased God to plant some little islands as resting-places in
the great waste of waters, some resting station.&nbsp; But no, we
must keep on, on, with everything in motion that your eye could
rest on.&nbsp; Everything tumbling about . . . We lived through
it, however, and the sun of Sunday morn rose clear and
bright.&nbsp; A pilot got on board about seven and at ten we were
in Liverpool.</p>
<p>We are at the Adelphi.&nbsp; Before I had taken off my bonnet
Mr. Richard Rathbone, one of the wealthiest merchants here,
called to invite us to dine the next day . . . Mrs. Richard
Rathbone has written that beautiful &ldquo;Diary of Lady
Willoughby,&rdquo; and, what is more, they say it is a perfect
reflect of her own lovely life and character.&nbsp; When she
published the book no one knew of it but her husband, not even
her brothers and sisters, and, of course, she constantly heard
speculations as to the authenticity of the book, and was often
appealed to for her opinion.&nbsp; She is very unpretending and
sweet in her manners; talks little, and seems not at all like a
literary lady.</p>
<p>I like these people in Liverpool.&nbsp; They seem to me to
think less of fashion and more of substantial excellence than our
wealthy people.&nbsp; I am not sure but the existence of a higher
class above them has a favorable effect, by limiting them in some
ways.&nbsp; There is much less show of furniture in the houses
than with us, though their servants and equipages are in much
better keeping.&nbsp; I am not sorry to be detained here for a
few days by my illness to become acquainted with them, and I
think your father likes it also, and will find it useful to
him.&nbsp; Let me say, while I think of it, how much I was
pleased with the <i>Great Western</i>.&nbsp; That upper saloon
with the air passing through it was a great comfort to me.&nbsp;
The captain, the servants, the table, are all excellent.&nbsp;
Everything on board was as nice as in the best hotel, and my
gruels and broths beautifully made.&nbsp; One of the stewardesses
did more for me than I ever had done by any servant of my own . .
. Your father and Louisa <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a> were ill but three or
four days, and then your father read Tacitus and talked to the
ladies, while Louisa played with the other children.</p>
<p>The Adelphi, my first specimen of an English hotel, is
perfectly comfortable, and though an immense establishment, is
quiet as a private house.&nbsp; There is none of the bustle of
the Astor, and if I ring my bedroom bell it is answered by a
woman who attends to me assiduously.&nbsp; The landlord pays us a
visit every day to know if we have all we wish.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
Sunday, November 1.</p>
<p>Here I am in the mighty heart, but before I say one word about
it I will go on from Wednesday evening with my journal.&nbsp; On
Thursday, though still very feeble, I dined at Green Bank, the
country-seat of Mr. William Rathbone.&nbsp; I was unwilling to
leave Liverpool without sharing with your father some of the
hospitalities offered to us and made a great effort to go.&nbsp;
The place is very beautiful and the house full of comfortable
elegance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image8" href="images/p8b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Aston Hall (Bracebridge Hall)"
title=
"Aston Hall (Bracebridge Hall)"
 src="images/p8s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The next morning we started for Birmingham, ninety-seven miles
from Liverpool, on our way to London, as I am unable to travel
the whole way in a day.&nbsp; On this railway I felt for the
first time the superiority of England to our own country.&nbsp;
The cars are divided into first, second, and third classes.&nbsp;
We took a first-class car, which has all the comforts of a
private carriage.</p>
<p>Just as we entered Birmingham I observed the finest seat,
surrounded by a park wall and with a very picturesque old church,
that I had seen on the way.&nbsp; On enquiring of young Mr. Van
Wart, who came to see us in Birmingham (the nephew of Washington
Irving), whose place it was, he said it was now called Aston Hall
and was owned by Mr. Watt, but it was formerly owned by the
Bracebridges, and was the veritable &ldquo;Bracebridge
Hall,&rdquo; and that his uncle had passed his Christmas
there.</p>
<p>On arriving here we found our rooms all ready for us at
Long&rsquo;s Hotel, kept by Mr. Markwell, a wine merchant.&nbsp;
The house is in New Bond Street, in the very centre of movement
at the West End, and Mr. Markwell full of personal assiduity,
which we never see with us.&nbsp; He comes to the carriage
himself, gives me his arm to go upstairs, is so much obliged to
us for honoring his house, ushers you in to dinner, at least on
the first day, and seats you, etc., etc.</p>
<p>Do not imagine us in fresh, new-looking rooms as we should be
in New York or Philadelphia.&nbsp; No, in London even new things
look old, but almost everything <i>is</i> old.&nbsp; Our parlor
has three windows down to the floor, but it is very dark.&nbsp;
The paint is maple color, and everything is dingy in
appearance.&nbsp; The window in my bedroom looks like a horn
lantern, so thick is the smoke, and yet everything is
scrupulously clean.&nbsp; On our arrival, Boyd, the Secretary of
Legation, soon came, and stayed to dine with us at six.&nbsp; Our
dinner was an excellent soup, the boiled cod garnished with fried
smelts, the roast beef and a <i>fricandeau</i> with sweet breads,
then a pheasant, and afterwards, dessert.</p>
<p>This morning Mr. Bates came very early to see us, and then Mr.
Joseph Coolidge, who looks very young and handsome; then Mr.
Colman, who also looks very well, Mr. Boyd and a Mr. Haight, of
New York, and Mr. Gair, son of Mr. Gair of Liverpool, a pleasing
young man.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Monday Evening.</p>
<p>This morning came Mr. Aspinwall, then Captain Wormeley, then
Dr. Holland, then Mrs. Bates, then Mr. Joseph Jay and his sister,
then Tom Appleton, Mrs. and Miss Wormeley, and Mrs. Franklin
Dexter.&nbsp; Dr. Holland came a second time to take me a drive,
but Mrs. Bates being with me he took your father.&nbsp; Mrs.
Bates took me to do some shopping, and to see about some
houses.&nbsp; They are very desirous we should be in their
neighborhood, in Portland Place, but I have a fancy myself for
the new part of town.&nbsp; I have been so used all my life to
see things fresh and clean-looking, that I cannot get accustomed
to the London dinge, and some of the finest houses look to me as
though I would like to give them a good scouring.&nbsp; Tell
Cousin M. never to come to England, she would be shocked every
minute, with all the grandeur.&nbsp; A new country is
cleaner-looking, though it may not be so picturesque.</p>
<p>I got your letters when I arrived here, and I wish this may
give you but a little pleasure they gave me.&nbsp; Pray never let
a steamer come without a token from both of you . . . With love
to Grandma and Uncle Thomas, believe me, with more love than ever
before,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth D.

<h3><i>To W. D. B. and A. B.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
November 3, 1846.</p>
<p>. . . This day, at five, your father had his first interview
with Lord Palmerston, who will acquaint the Queen with his
arrival, and after she has received him we shall leave our cards
upon all the ministers and <i>corps diplomatique</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">November 4th.</p>
<p>Your father had a most agreeable dinner at Lord
Holland&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He met there Lord and Lady Palmerston,
Lord Morpeth, Lord de Mauley, Mr. Harcourt, a son of the
Archbishop of York, etc.&nbsp; He took out Lady Holland and Lord
Morpeth, Lady Palmerston, the only ladies present.&nbsp; Holland
House is surrounded by 200 acres in the midst of the western part
of London, or rather Kensington.&nbsp; Lord Holland has no
children, and the family dies with him.&nbsp; They dined in the
room in which Addison died.</p>

</a></p>
<p>To-day, to my surprise, came Lady Palmerston, which was a
great courtesy, as it was my place to make the first visit.&nbsp;
She is the sister of Lord Melbourne.&nbsp; Lord de Mauley has
also been here. . . .&nbsp; To-day I have been driving through
some of the best streets in London, and my ideas of its extent
and magnificence are rising fast.&nbsp; The houses are more
picturesque than ours, and some of them most noble.&nbsp; The
vastness of a great capital like this cannot burst upon one at
once.&nbsp; Its effect increases daily.&nbsp; The extent of the
Park, surrounded by mansions which look, some of them, like a
whole history in themselves, has to-day quite dazzled my
imagination.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">November 5th.</p>
<p>This morning, Thursday, came an invitation to dine with Lord
and Lady Palmerston on Saturday.&nbsp; Sir George Grey, another
of the ministers, came to see us to-day and Lord Mahon.&nbsp;
Your father and I have been all the morning looking at houses,
and have nearly concluded upon one in Eaton Square.&nbsp; We find
a hotel very expensive, and not very comfortable for us, as your
father is very restive without his books about him.&nbsp; Mr.
Harcourt also came to see us to-day.&nbsp; I mention as many of
the names of our visitors as I can recollect, as it will give you
some idea of the composition of English society . . .&nbsp; This
moment a large card in an envelope has been brought me, which
runs thus: &ldquo;The Lord Steward has received Her
Majesty&rsquo;s commands to invite Mr. Bancroft to dinner at
Windsor Castle on Thursday, 12th November, to remain until
Friday, 13th.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am glad he will dine there before
me, that he may tell me the order of performances.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Friday, November 6th.</p>
<p>. . . We had to-day a delightful visit from Rogers, the Poet,
who is now quite old, but with a most interesting
countenance.&nbsp; He was full of cordiality, and, at parting, as
he took my hand, said: &ldquo;Our acquaintance must become
friendship.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Harcourt came again and sat an hour
with us, and has introduced your father at the Traveller&rsquo;s
Club and the Athen&aelig;um Club.&nbsp; To-night came my new
lady&rsquo;s maid, Russell.&nbsp; She dresses hair beautifully,
but is rather too great a person to suit my fancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Sunday Evening, November 8th.</p>
<p>On Friday evening we met at Mrs. Wormeley&rsquo;s a cosy
little knot of Americans.&nbsp; The Dexters were staying there
and there were Mr. and Mrs. Atkinson and Miss Pratt, Mr. and Mrs.
Aspinwall, Mr. and Miss Jay, Mr. and Mrs. Putnam, Mr. Colman, Mr.
Pickering, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Wednesday Evening.</p>
<p>On Monday we came to our <i>home</i>, preferring it to the
hotel, though it is not yet in order for our reception, and we
have not yet all our servants.&nbsp; Last evening we dined with
Lord Morpeth at his father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; His family are
all out of town, but he remains because of his ministerial
duties.&nbsp; Lord Morpeth took me out and I sat between him and
Sir George Grey.&nbsp; Your father took out Lady Theresa Lewis,
who is a sister of Lord Clarendon.&nbsp; She was full of
intelligence and I like her extremely.&nbsp; Baron and Lady Parke
(a distinguished judge), Lady Morgan, Mr. Mackintosh, Dr. and
Mrs. Holland (Sidney Smith&rsquo;s daughter), and Mr. and Mrs.
Franklin Dexter, with several others were the party.</p>
<p>During dinner one gentleman was so very agreeable that I
wondered who he could be, but as Lord Palmerston had told me that
Mr. Macaulay was in Edinburgh, I did not think of him.&nbsp;
After the ladies left the gentlemen, my first question to Mrs.
Holland was the name of her next neighbor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, Mr.
Macaulay,&rdquo; was her answer, and I was pleased not to have
been disappointed in a person of whom I had heard so much.&nbsp;
When the gentlemen came in I was introduced to him and talked to
him and heard him talk not a little.</p>
<p>These persons all came the next day to see us, which gave rise
to fresh invitations.</p>
<p>This morning we have been driving round to leave cards on the
<i>corps diplomatique</i>, and Mr. Harcourt has taken me all over
the Athen&aelig;um Club-house, a superb establishment.&nbsp; They
have given your father an invitation to the Club, a privilege
which is sometimes sought for years, Mr. Harcourt says. . .
.&nbsp; Have I not needed all my energies?&nbsp; We have been
here just a fortnight, and I came so ill that I could hardly
walk.&nbsp; We are now at housekeeping, and I am in the full
career in London society.&nbsp; They told me I should see no one
until spring, but you see we dine out or go out in the evening
almost every day. . . .&nbsp; For the gratification of S. D. or
Aunt I., who may wonder how I get along in dress matters, going
out as I did in my plain black dress, I will tell you that Mrs.
Murray, the Queen&rsquo;s dressmaker, made me, as soon as I found
these calls and invitations pouring in, two dresses.&nbsp; One of
black velvet, very low, with short sleeves, and another of very
rich black watered silk, with drapery of black tulle on the
corsage and sleeves. . . .&nbsp; I have fitted myself with
several pretty little head-dresses, some in silver, some with
plumes, but all white, and I find my velvet and silk suit all
occasions.&nbsp; I do not like dining with bare arms and neck,
but I must.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">Tuesday, November 17th.</p>
<p>Last evening we passed at the Earl of Auckland&rsquo;s, the
head of the Admiralty.&nbsp; The party was at the Admiralty,
where there is a beautiful residence for the first lord. . .
.&nbsp; I had a long talk with Lord Morpeth last evening about
Mr. Sumner, and told him of his nomination.&nbsp; He has a strong
regard for him. . . .&nbsp; Not a moment have I had to a London
&ldquo;lion.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have driven past Westminster, but
have not been in it.&nbsp; I have seen nothing of London but what
came in my way in returning visits.</p>
<h3><i>To I. P. D.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
November 17, 1846.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Uncle</span>: I cannot help
refreshing the remembrance of me with you and dear Aunty by
addressing a separate letter to you. . . .&nbsp; Yesterday we
hailed with delight our letters from home. . . .&nbsp; One feels
in a foreign land the absence of common sympathies and interests,
which always surround us in any part of our own country.&nbsp;
And yet nothing can exceed the kindness with which we have been
received here.</p>
<p>Last evening I went to my first great English dinner and it
was a most agreeable one. . . .&nbsp; It seems a little odd to a
republican woman to find herself in right of her country taking
precedence of marchionesses, but one soon gets used to all
things.&nbsp; We sat down to dinner at eight and got through
about ten.&nbsp; When the ladies rose, I found I was expected to
go first.&nbsp; After dinner other guests were invited and to the
first person who came in, about half-past ten, Lady Palmerston
said: &ldquo;Oh, thank you for coming so early.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
was Lady Tankerville of the old French family of de Grammont and
niece to Prince Polignac.&nbsp; The next was Lady Emily de Burgh,
the daughter of the Marchioness of Clanricarde, a beautiful girl
of seventeen.&nbsp; She is very lovely, wears a Grecian braid
round her head like a coronet, and always sits by her mother,
which would not suit our young girls.&nbsp; Then came Lord and
Lady Ashley, Lord Ebrington, and so many titled personages that I
cannot remember half.</p>
<p>The dinner is much the same as ours in all its modes of
serving, but they have soles and turbot, instead of our fishes,
and their pheasants are not our pheasants, or their partridges
our partridges.&nbsp; Neither have we so many footmen with
liveries of all colours, or so much gold and silver plate. . .
.&nbsp; The next morning Mr. Bancroft breakfasted with Dr.
Holland to meet the Marquis of Lansdowne alone.&nbsp; [Thursday]
he went down to Windsor to dine with the Queen.&nbsp; He took out
to dinner the Queen&rsquo;s mother, the Duchess of Kent, the
Queen going with the Prince of Saxe-Weimar, who was paying a
visit at the Castle.&nbsp; He talked German to the Duchess during
dinner, which I suspect she liked, for the Queen spoke of it to
him afterwards, and Lord Palmerston told me the Duchess said he
spoke very pure German.&nbsp; While he was dining at Windsor I
went to a party all alone at the Countess Grey&rsquo;s, which I
thought required some courage.</p>
<p>Of all the persons I see here the Marquis of Lansdowne excites
the most lively regard.&nbsp; His countenance and manners are
full of benevolence and I think he understands America better
than anyone else of the high aristocracy.&nbsp; I told him I was
born at Plymouth and was as proud of my pure Anglo-Saxon Pilgrim
descent as if it were traced from a line of Norman
Conquerors.&nbsp; Nearly all the ministers and their wives came
to see us immediately, without waiting for us to make the first
visit, which is the rule, and almost every person whom we have
met in society, which certainly indicates an amiable feeling
toward our country.&nbsp; We could not well have received more
courtesy than we have done, and it has been extended freely and
immediately, without waiting for the forms of etiquette.&nbsp;
Pray say to Mr. Everett how often we hear persons speak of him,
and with highest regard.&nbsp; I feel as if we were reaping some
of the fruits of his sowing.</p>
<p>Mr. Bancroft sends you a pack of cards, one of the identical
two packs with which the Queen played Patience the evening he was
at Windsor.&nbsp; They were the perquisite of a page who brought
them to him.&nbsp; He was much pleased with the Queen and thought
her much prettier than any representation of her which we have
seen, and with a very sweet expression.&nbsp; Lady Holland had
been staying two or three days at Windsor, and was to leave the
next morning.&nbsp; When the Queen took leave of her at night,
she kissed her quite in my Virginia fashion.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Uncle</span>: How much more your
niece would have written if to-day were not packet day, I cannot
say.&nbsp; I shall send you some newspapers and a pack of cards
which I saw in the Queen&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; The American
Minister and Mrs. Bancroft have since played a game of piquet
with them.&nbsp; The Queen&rsquo;s hands were as clean as her
smile was gracious.&nbsp; Best regards to the Judge and Aunt
Isaac.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours most truly,<br />

<p>After a long interval I find again a quiet Sunday evening to
resume my journal to you.&nbsp; On Monday we dined at Lord John
Russell&rsquo;s, and met many of the persons we have met before
and the Duchess of Inverness, the widow of the Duke of
Sussex.&nbsp; On Tuesday we dined at Dr. Holland&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
His wife and daughter are charming, and then we met, besides,
Lady Charlotte Lindsay, the only surviving child of Lord North,
Mr. and Mrs. Milman (the author of the &ldquo;Fall of
Jerusalem&rdquo;), and Mr. Macaulay.&nbsp; Yesterday I went to
return the visit of the Milmans and found that the entrance to
their house, he being a prebend of Westminster Abbey, was
actually in the cloisters of the Abbey.&nbsp; They were not at
home, but I took my footman and wandered at leisure through the
cloisters, treading at every step on the tomb of some old abbot
with dates of 1160 and thereabouts.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more delightful than London is now, if I had
only a little more physical vigor to enjoy it.&nbsp; We see
everybody more frequently, and know them better than in the full
season, and we have some of the best specimens of English
society, too, here just now, as the Whig ministry brings a good
deal of the ability of the aristocracy to its aid.&nbsp; The
subjects of conversation among women are more general than with
us, and [they] are much more cultivated than our women as a body,
not our blues.&nbsp; They never sew, or attend, as we do, to
domestic affairs, and so live for social life and understand it
better.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
December 2, 1846.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Polk</span>: <a
name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28"
class="citation">[28]</a> you told me when I parted from you at
Washington that you would like to get from me occasionally some
accounts of my experiences in English society.&nbsp; I thought at
that time that we should see very little of it until the spring,
but contrary to my expectation we have been out almost every day
since our arrival.&nbsp; We made our <i>d&eacute;but</i> in
London on the first day of November (the suicidal month you know)
in the midst of an orange-colored fog, in which you could not see
your hand before you.&nbsp; The prospect for the winter seemed, I
must say, rather &ldquo;triste,&rdquo; but the next day the fog
cleared off, people came constantly to see us, and we had
agreeable invitations for every day, and London put on a new
aspect.&nbsp; Out first dinner was at Lord Palmerston&rsquo;s,
where we met what the newspapers call a distinguished
circle.&nbsp; The Marquis of Lansdowne, Lord and Lady John
Russell, Marquis and Marchioness of Clanricarde (Canning&rsquo;s
daughter), Earl and Countess Grey, Sir George and Lady Grey,
etc., etc.&nbsp; I was taken out by Lord Palmerston, with Lord
Grey on the other side, and found the whole thing very like one
of our Washington dinners, and I was quite as much at my ease,
and they seemed made of the same materials as our cabinet at
home.&nbsp; I have since dined at Lord Morpeth&rsquo;s, Lord John
Russell&rsquo;s, Lord Mahon&rsquo;s, Dr. Holland&rsquo;s, Baron
Parke&rsquo;s, The Prussian Minister&rsquo;s, and to-day we dine
with the Duchess of Inverness, the widow of the Duke of Sussex;
to-morrow with Mr. Milman, a prebend of Westminster and a
distinguished man of letters.&nbsp; We have been at a great many
<i>soir&eacute;es</i>, at Lady Palmerston&rsquo;s, Lady
Grey&rsquo;s, Lord Auckland&rsquo;s, Lady Lewis&rsquo;s, etc.,
etc.</p>
<p>And now, having given you some idea <i>whom</i> we are seeing
here, you will wish to know how I like them, and how they differ
from our own people.&nbsp; At the smaller dinners and
<i>soir&eacute;es</i> at this season I cannot, of course, receive
a full impression of English society, but certainly those persons
now in town are charming people.&nbsp; Their manners are
perfectly simple and I entirely forget, except when their
historic names fall upon my ear, that I am with the proud
aristocracy of England.&nbsp; All the persons whose names I have
mentioned to you give one a decided impression not only of
ability and agreeable manners, but of excellence and the domestic
virtues.&nbsp; The furniture and houses, too, are less splendid
and ostentatious, than those of our large cities, though [they]
have more plate, and liveried servants.&nbsp; The forms of
society and the standard of dress, too, are very like ours,
except that a duchess or a countess has more hereditary point
lace and diamonds.&nbsp; The general style of dress, perhaps, is
not so tasteful, so simply elegant as ours.&nbsp; Upon the whole
I think more highly of our own country (I mean from a social
point of view alone) than before I came abroad.&nbsp; There is
less superiority over us in manners and all the social arts than
I could have believed possible in a country where a large and
wealthy class have been set apart from time immemorial to create,
as it were, a social standard of high refinement.&nbsp; The chief
difference that I perceive is this: In our country the position
of everybody is undefined and rests altogether upon public
opinion.&nbsp; This leads sometimes to a little assumption and
pretension of manner, which the highest class here, whose claims
are always allowed by all about them, are never tempted to put
on.&nbsp; From this results an extreme simplicity of manner, like
that of a family circle among us.</p>
<p>What I have said, however, applies less to the South than to
the large cities of the North, with which I am most familiar at
home.&nbsp; I hope our memory will not be completely effaced in
Washington, for we cling to our friends there with strong
interest.&nbsp; Present my respectful regards to the President,
and my love to Mrs. Walker and Miss Rucker.&nbsp; To the Masons
also, and our old colleagues all, and pray lay your royal
commands upon somebody to write me.&nbsp; I long to know what is
going on in Washington.&nbsp; The Pleasantons promised to do so,
and Annie Payne, to whom and to Mrs. Madison give also my best
love.&nbsp; Believe me yours with the highest regard.</p>

<p>Yesterday we dined at the Prussian Minister&rsquo;s, Chevalier
Bunsen&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He met your father in Rome twenty years
since, and has received us with great enthusiasm.&nbsp; Yesterday
at dinner he actually rose in his seat and made quite a speech
welcoming him to England as historian, old friend, etc., and
ended by offering his health, which your father replied to
shortly, in a few words.&nbsp; Imagine such an outbreak upon
routine at a dinner in England!&nbsp; Nobody could have done it
but one of German blood, but I dare say the Everetts, who know
him, could imagine it all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sons</span>: . . . Yesterday we
dined at Macready&rsquo;s and met quite a new, and to us, a most
agreeable circle.&nbsp; There was Carlyle, who talked all
dinner-time in his broad Scotch, in the most inimitable
way.&nbsp; He is full of wit, and happened to get upon James I.,
upon which topic he was superb.&nbsp; Then there was Babbage, the
great mathematician, Fonblanc, the editor of the <i>Examiner</i>,
etc., etc.&nbsp; The day before we dined at Mr. Frederick
Elliott&rsquo;s with a small party of eight, of which Lady Morgan
was one, and also a brother of Lord Normanby&rsquo;s, whom I
liked very much.&nbsp; Lady Morgan, who had not hitherto much
pleased me, came out in this small circle with all her Irish wit
and humor, and gave me quite new notions of her talent.&nbsp; She
made me laugh till I cried.&nbsp; On Saturday we dined at Sir
Roderick Murchison&rsquo;s, the President of the Geological
Society, very great in the scientific way.</p>

<p>We have struck up a great friendship with Miss Murray, the
Queen&rsquo;s Maid of Honor, who paid me a visit of three hours
to-day, in the midst of which came in Colonel Estcourt, whom I
was delighted to see, as you may suppose.&nbsp; Miss Murray is to
me a very interesting person, though a great talker; a convenient
fault to a stranger.&nbsp; She is connected with half the noble
families in England, is the grand-daughter of the Duchess of
Athol, who governed the Isle of Man as a queen, and the
descendant of Scott&rsquo;s Countess of Derby.&nbsp; Though
sprung of such Tory blood, and a maid of honor, she thinks freely
upon all subjects.&nbsp; Religion, politics, and persons, she
decides upon for herself, and has as many benevolent schemes as
old Madam Jackson.</p>
<p>I returned the visit of Mr. and Mrs. Leslie, the painter, this
week, and saw the picture he is now painting for the
Vice-Chancellor.&nbsp; It is a sketch of children, a boy driving
his two little sisters as horses.&nbsp; One of the little girls
is very like Susie, <a name="citation37"></a><a
href="#footnote37" class="citation">[37]</a> her size, hair, and
complexion.&nbsp; How I longed to be rich enough to order a copy,
but his pictures cost a fortune.&nbsp; I paid also a visit this
week to the Duchess of Inverness, whom I found in the prettiest,
cosiest morning boudoir looking onto the gardens of the
Palace.&nbsp; In short, I do, or see, every hour, something that
if I were a traveller only, I could make quite a story of.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sons</span>: . . .&nbsp; I wrote
my last sheet on the 19th and your father went on that day to
Cambridge to be present at the tri-centennial celebration of
Trinity College . . . He went also the day after the anniversary,
which was on our 22nd December, to Ely, with Peacock, the great
mathematician, who is Dean of Ely, to see the great cathedral
there . . . While he was at Cambridge I passed the evening of the
22nd at Lady Morgan&rsquo;s, who happened to have a most
agreeable set . . . Lady Morgan&rsquo;s reunions are entertaining
to me because they are collections of lions, but they are not
strictly and exclusively fashionable.&nbsp; They remind me in
their composition from various circles of Mrs. Otis&rsquo;s
parties in Boston.&nbsp; We have in this respect an advantage
over the English themselves, as in our position we see a great
variety of cliques.</p>
<p>For instance, last evening, the 31st, I took Louisa, at
half-past seven, to the house of Mr. Hawes, an under Secretary of
State, to see a beautiful children&rsquo;s masque.&nbsp; It was
an impersonation of the &ldquo;Old Year&rdquo; dressed a little
like <i>Lear</i> with snowy hair and draperies.&nbsp; <i>Old
Year</i> played his part inimitably, at times with great pathos,
and then introducing witty hits at all the doings of his reign,
such as exploding cotton, the new planet, a subject which he put
at rest as &ldquo;<i>far beyond our reach</i>,&rdquo; etc.,
etc.&nbsp; He then introduced one by one the children of all ages
as &ldquo;Days&rdquo; of the coming year.&nbsp; There was
<i>Twelfth Day</i>, crowned as Queen with her cake in her hands;
there was <i>Christmas</i>, covered with holly and mistletoe;
there was <i>April Fool&rsquo;s Day</i>, dressed as Harlequin;
there was, above all, <i>Shrove Tuesday</i>, with her frying-pan
of pancakes, dressed as a little cook; there was a charming boy
of fourteen or fifteen, as <i>St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day</i> with
his packet of valentines addressed to the young ladies present;
there was the <i>5th of November</i>, full of wit and fun, etc.;
the longest day, an elder brother, of William&rsquo;s height,
with a cap of three or four feet high; and his little sister of
five, as the shortest day.&nbsp; This was all arranged to music
and each made little speeches, introducing themselves.&nbsp; The
<i>Old Year</i>, after introducing his successors, and after much
pathos, is &ldquo;going, going&mdash;gone,&rdquo; and falls
covered with his drapery, upon removing which, instead of the
lifeless body of the <i>Old Year</i>, is discovered a sweet
little flower-crowned girl of five or six, as the <i>New
Year</i>.&nbsp; It was charming, and I was so pleased that,
instead of taking Louisa away at nine o&rsquo;clock as I
intended, I left her to see &ldquo;Sir Roger de Coverly,&rdquo;
in the dress of his time.</p>

<p>Last night at Mr. Putnam&rsquo;s, I met William and Mary
Howitt, and some of the lesser lights.&nbsp; I have put down my
pen to answer a note, just brought in, to dine next Thursday with
the Dowager Countess of Charleville, where we were last week, in
the evening.&nbsp; She is eighty-four (tell this to Grandmamma)
and likes still to surround herself with <i>beaux</i> and
<i>belles esprits</i>, and as her son and daughter reside with
her, this is still easy . . . The old lady talks French as fast
as possible, and troubles me somewhat by talking it to me,
forgetting that a foreign minister&rsquo;s wife can talk English
. . . Your father likes to be here.&nbsp; He has copying going on
in the State Paper Office and British Museum, and his heart is
full of manuscripts.&nbsp; It is the first thought, I believe,
whoever he sees, what papers are in their family.&nbsp; He makes
great interest with even the ladies sometimes for this
purpose.&nbsp; Upon the whole, I love my own country better than
ever, but whether I shall not miss, upon my return, some things
to which I am gradually getting accustomed, I have yet to
learn.&nbsp; The gratification of mixing constantly with those
foremost in the world for rank, science, literature, or all which
adorns society is great, but there is a certain yearning toward
those whose habits, education, and modes of thought are the same
as our own, which I never can get over.&nbsp; In the full tide of
conversation I often stop and think, &ldquo;I may unconsciously
be jarring the prejudices or preconceived notions of these people
upon a thousand points; for how differently have I been trained
from these women of high rank, and men, too, with whom I am now
thrown.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon all topics we are accustomed to think,
perhaps, with more latitude, religion, politics, morals,
everything.&nbsp; I like the English extremely, even more than I
expected, and yet happy am I to think that our own best portions
of society can bear a comparison with theirs.&nbsp; When I see
you I can explain to you the differences, but I think we need not
be ashamed of ourselves.</p>
<h3><i>To I. P. D.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
January 2, 1847.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Uncle</span>: . . . I refer you to
my letters to my boys, for all the new persons and places we may
have seen lately, while I give you for Aunty&rsquo;s amusement a
minute account of my visit into the country at Mr. Bates&rsquo;s,
where things are managed in a scrupulously English manner, so
that it will give her the same idea of country life here, as if
it were a nobleman&rsquo;s castle.&nbsp; Our invitation was to
arrive on Thursday, the day before Christmas, to dine, and to
remain until the following Tuesday morning.&nbsp; His place is at
East <i>Sheen</i>, which receives its name from the Anglo-Saxon
word for <i>beauty</i>.&nbsp; It adjoins Richmond Park, beyond
which is the celebrated Richmond Hill, Twickenham, Kew, etc.,
etc. . . . We arrived at East Sheen at half-past five; but I
ought first to mention the <i>preparations</i> for a country
excursion.&nbsp; Our own carriage has, of course, no dickey for
my maid, or conveniences for luggage, so we take a travelling
carriage.&nbsp; The imperials (which are large, flat boxes,
covering the whole top of the carriage, <i>capital</i> for velvet
dresses, and smaller ones fitting into all the seats <i>in</i>
the carriage, and <i>before</i> and <i>behind</i>) are brought to
you the day before.&nbsp; I am merely asked what dresses I wish
taken, and that is all I know of the matter, so thoroughly does
an English maid understand her business.&nbsp; We were shown on
our arrival into a charming room, semi-library.</p>
<p>In a few minutes a servant came to show me to my apartment,
which was very superb, with a comfortable dressing-room and fire
for Mr. Bancroft, where the faithful Keats unpacked his dressing
materials, while I was in a few moments seated at the toilet to
undergo my hair-dressing, surrounded by all my apparatus, and a
blazing fire to welcome me with a hissing tea-kettle of hot water
and every comfort.&nbsp; How well the English understand it, I
learn more and more every day.&nbsp; My maid had a large room
above me, also with a fire; indeed, a &ldquo;lady&rsquo;s&rdquo;
maid is a <i>very great</i> character <i>indeed</i>, and would be
much more unwilling to take her tea with, or speak familiarly to,
a footman or a housemaid than I should.&nbsp; My greatest
mistakes in England have been committed toward those high
dignitaries, my own maid and the butler, whose grandeur I
entirely misappreciated and invaded, as in my ignorance I placed
them, as we do, on the same level with other servants.&nbsp; She
has her fire made for her, and <i>loaf</i> sugar in her tea,
which she and Cates sip in solitary majesty.&nbsp; However, she
is most conscientious and worthy, as well as dignified, and
thoroughly accomplished in her business.&nbsp; As all these
things are pictures of English life, I mention them to amuse
Aunty, who likes to know how these matters are managed.</p>
<p>After I am dressed, I join the circle in the library, where I
am introduced to Mr. and Madam Van de Weyer, and Louis
Buonaparte, the son of Louis, the ex-King of Holland, and of
Hortense, Josephine&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; He was a long time
imprisoned in the fortress of Ham, and has not long been
free.&nbsp; There was also Napoleon, son of Jerome Buonaparte,
and the Princess of Wurtemberg.&nbsp; They were most agreeable,
intelligent, and amiable young men, and I was glad to meet
them.&nbsp; Lord and Lady Langdale (who have a place in the
neighborhood) were invited to dine with us.&nbsp; He is Master of
the Rolls and was elevated to the peerage from great distinction
at the bar.&nbsp; Lady Langdale is a sensible and excellent
person.&nbsp; At dinner I sat between Mr. Bates and Lord
Langdale, whom I liked very much.</p>
<p>The next morning we assembled at ten for breakfast, which was
at a round table, with a sort of circular tray, which turns at
the least touch in the centre, leaving only a rim round the table
for plates and cups.&nbsp; This was covered also with a white
cloth and on it were placed all the breakfast viands, with
butter, sugar, cream, bread, toast-rack and preserves.&nbsp; You
need no servants, but turn it round and help yourself.&nbsp; I
believe the Van de Weyers introduced it, from a visit in
Wales.&nbsp; Tea and coffee are served from a side-table always,
here.&nbsp; Let me tell Aunty that our simple breakfast
<i>dress</i> is unknown in England.&nbsp; You come down in the
morning dressed for the day, until six or seven in the evening,
when your dress is low neck and short sleeves for dinner.&nbsp;
At this season the morning dress is a rich silk or velvet, high
body quite close in the throat with handsome collar and cuffs,
and <i>always</i> a cap.&nbsp; Madam Van de Weyer wore every day
a different dress, all very rich, but I adhered to a black
watered silk with the same simple cap I wore at home.</p>
<p>I took a drive through Richmond Park (where Henry the Eighth
watched to see a signal on the Tower when Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s
head fell, and galloped off to marry Jane Seymour) to Richmond
Terrace, which is ravishingly beautiful even at this season. . .
. The next day the gentleman all went to town, and Madam Van de
Weyer and I passed the day <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>,
very pleasantly, as her experience in diplomatic life is very
useful to me. . . .&nbsp; Her manners are very pleasing and
entirely unaffected.&nbsp; She has great tact and quickness of
perception, great intelligence and amiability and is altogether
extremely well-fitted for the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> she plays in
life.&nbsp; Her husband is charming. . . . They have three
children, very lovely.&nbsp; The eldest, Victor, a fine boy of
seven years old, Victoria, a girl of four, for whom the Queen was
sponsor, and Albert, to whom Prince Albert performed the same
office.&nbsp; This was, of course, voluntary in the royal
parties, as it was not a favor to be asked. . . .&nbsp; Madam Van
de Weyer is not spoiled, certainly, by the prominent part she was
called to play in this great centre of the world at so early an
age, and makes an excellent courtier.&nbsp; I could not help
pitying her, however, for looking forward to going through, year
after year, the same round of ceremonies, forms, and
society.&nbsp; For us, it is a new study, and invaluable for a
short time; but I could not bear it for life, as these European
diplomatists.&nbsp; Besides, we Americans really enjoy a kind of
society, and a much nearer intercourse than other foreigners, in
the literary, scientific, and even social circles.</p>
<p>On Saturday evening Lord William Fitzroy and daughter joined
our party with Sir William Hooker and Lady Hooker. . . . Sir
William Hooker is one of the most interesting persons I have seen
in England.&nbsp; He is a great naturalist and has the charge of
the great Botanical Gardens at Kew.&nbsp; He devoted a morning to
us there, and it was the most delightful one I have passed.&nbsp;
There are twenty-eight different conservatories filled with the
vegetable wonders of the whole world.&nbsp; Length of time and
regal wealth have conspired to make the Kew gardens beyond our
conceptions entirely. . . . Sir William pointed out to us all
that was very rare or curious, which added much to my pleasure. .
. . He showed us a drawing of the largest <i>flower</i> ever
known on earth, which Sir Stamford Raffles discovered in
Sumatra.&nbsp; It was a parasite without leaves or stem, and the
flower weighed fifteen pounds.&nbsp; Lady Raffles furnished him
the materials for the drawing.&nbsp; I dined in company with her
not long ago, and regret now that I did not make her tell me
about the wonders of that region.&nbsp; At the same dinner you
may meet so many people, each having their peculiar gift, that
one cannot avail oneself of the opportunity of extracting from
each what is precious.&nbsp; I always wish I could sit by
everybody at the same time, and I could often employ a dozen
heads, if I had them, instead of my poor, miserable one.&nbsp;
From Sir William Hooker <i>I</i> learned as much about the
<i>vegetable</i> world, as Mr. Bancroft did from the Dean of Ely
on <i>architecture</i>, when he expounded to him the cathedral of
Ely; pointing out the successive styles of the Gothic, and the
different periods in which the different parts were built.&nbsp;
Books are dull teachers compared with these gifted men giving you
a lecture upon subjects before your eyes.</p>
<p>On Sunday we dined with out own party; on Monday some
diplomatic people, the Lisboas and one of Mr. Bates&rsquo;s
partners, and on Tuesday we came home.&nbsp; I must not omit a
visit while we were there from Mr. Taylor (Van Artevelde), who is
son-in-law of Lord Monteagle, and lives in the
neighborhood.&nbsp; He has a fine countenance and still finer
voice, and is altogether one of those literary persons who do not
disappoint you, but whose whole being is equal to their
works.&nbsp; I hope to see more of him, as they spoke of
&ldquo;<i>cultivating</i>&rdquo; us, and Mr. Taylor was quite a
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of our kind and dear friend, Dr.
Holland, and dedicated his last poem to him.&nbsp; This
expression, &ldquo;I shall <i>cultivate</i> you,&rdquo; we hear
constantly, and it strikes me as oddly as our Western
&ldquo;<i>being raised</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, I hear improper
Anglicisms constantly, and they have nearly as many as we
have.&nbsp; The upper classes, here, however, do <i>speak</i>
English so roundly and fully, giving every <i>letter</i> its due,
that it pleases my ear amazingly.</p>
<p>On Wednesday I go for the first time to Westminster Abbey, on
Epiphany, to hear the Athanasian Creed chanted.&nbsp; I have as
yet had no time for sight-seeing, as the days are so short that
necessary visits take all my time.&nbsp; No one goes out in a
carriage till after two, as the servants dine at one, and in the
morning early the footman is employed in the house.&nbsp; A
coachman never leaves his box here, and a footman is
indispensable on all occasions.&nbsp; No visit can be paid till
three; and this gives me very little time in these short
days.&nbsp; Everything here is inflexible as the laws of the
Medes and Persians, and though I am called &ldquo;Mistress&rdquo;
even by old Cates with his grey hair and black coat, I cannot
make one of them do anything, except <i>by</i> the person and
<i>at</i> the time which English custom prescribes.&nbsp; They
are brought up to fill certain situations, and fill them
perfectly, but cannot or will not vary.</p>
<p>I am frequently asked by the ladies here if I have formed a
household to please me and I am obliged to confess that I have a
very nice household, but that I am the only refractory member of
it.&nbsp; I am always asking the wrong person for coals, etc.,
etc.&nbsp; The division of labor, or rather ceremonies, between
the butler and footman, I have now mastered I believe in some
degree, but that between the <i>upper</i> and <i>under</i>
house-maid is still a profound mystery to me, though the upper
has explained to me for the twentieth time that she did only
&ldquo;the top of the work.&rdquo;&nbsp; My cook comes up to me
every morning for orders, and always drops the deepest curtsey,
but then I doubt if her hands are ever profaned by touching a
poker, and she <i>never</i> washes a dish.&nbsp; She is cook and
<i>housekeeper</i>, and presides over the housekeeper&rsquo;s
room; which has a Brussels carpet and centre table, with one side
entirely occupied by the linen presses, of which my maid (my
vice-regent, only <i>much</i> greater than me) keeps the key and
dispenses every towel, even for the kitchen.&nbsp; She keeps
lists of everything and would feel bound to replace anything
missing.&nbsp; I shall make you laugh and Mrs. Goodwin stare, by
some of my housekeeping stories, the next evening I pass in your
little pleasant parlor (a word unknown here).</p>
<h3><i>To W. D. B. and A. B.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
January 10, 1847.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My very dear Children</span>: . . .
Yesterday we dined at Lady Charleville&rsquo;s, the old lady of
eighty-four, at whose house I mentioned an evening visit in my
last, and I must tell you all about it to entertain dear
Grandma.&nbsp; I will be minute for once, and give you the
<i>little</i> details of a London dinner, and they are all
precisely alike.&nbsp; We arrived at Cavendish Square a quarter
before seven (very early) and were shown into a semi-library on
the same floor with the dining-room.&nbsp; The servants take your
cloak, etc., in the passage, and I am never shown into a room
with a mirror as with us, and never into a chamber or
bedroom.</p>
<p>We found Lady Charleville and her daughter with one young
gentleman with whom I chatted till dinner, and who, I found, was
Sir William Burdette, son of Sir Francis and brother of Miss
Angelina Coutts.&nbsp; I happened to have on the corsage of my
black velvet a white moss rose and buds, which I thought rather
youthful for <i>me</i>, but the old lady had [them] on her
cap.&nbsp; She is full of intelligence, and has always been in
the habit of drawing a great deal. . . . Very soon came in Lord
Aylmer, [who] was formerly Governor of Canada, and Lady
Colchester, daughter of Lord Ellenborough, a very pretty woman of
thirty-five, I should think; Sir William and Lady Chatterton and
Mr. Algernon Greville, whose grandmother wrote the beautiful
&ldquo;Prayer for Indifference,&rdquo; an old favorite of mine,
and Mr. MacGregor, the political economist.&nbsp; Lord Aylmer
took me out and I found him a nice old peer, and discovered that
ever since the death of his uncle, Lord Whitworth, whose title is
extinct, he had borne the arms of both Aylmer and
Whitworth.&nbsp; Mr. Bancroft took out Lady Colchester, and the
old lady was wheeled out precisely as Grandma is.</p>
<p>At table she helped to the fish (cod, garnished round with
smelts) and insisted on carving the turkey herself, which she did
extremely well.&nbsp; By the way, I observe they never carve the
breast of a turkey <i>longitudinally</i>, as we do, but in short
slices, a little diagonally from the centre.&nbsp; This makes
many more slices, and quite large enough where there are so many
other dishes.&nbsp; The four <i>entr&eacute;e</i> dishes are
always placed on the table when we sit down, according to our old
fashion, and not one by one.&nbsp; They have [them] warmed with
hot water, so that they keep hot while the soup and fish are
eaten.&nbsp; Turkey, even <i>boiled</i> turkey, is brought on
<i>after</i> the <i>entr&eacute;es</i>, mutton (a saddle always)
or venison, with a pheasant or partridges.&nbsp; With the roast
is always put on the <i>sweets</i>, as they are called, as the
term dessert seems restricted to the last course of fruits.&nbsp;
During the dinner there are always long strips of damask all
round the table which are removed before the dessert is put on,
and there is no brushing of crumbs.&nbsp; You may not care for
all this, but the housekeepers may.&nbsp; I had Mr. Greville the
other side of me, who seemed much surprised that I, an American,
should know the &ldquo;Prayer for Indifference,&rdquo; which he
doubted if twenty persons in England read in these modern
days.</p>
<p>It is a great mystery to me yet how people get to know each
other in London.&nbsp; Persons talk to you whom you do not know,
for no one is introduced, as a general rule.&nbsp; I have
sometimes quite an acquaintance with a person, and exchange
visits, and yet do not succeed for a long time in putting their
name and the person together. . . . It is a great puzzle to a
stranger, but has its conveniences for the English
themselves.&nbsp; We are endeavoring to become acquainted with
the English mind, not only through society, but through its
products in other ways.&nbsp; Natural science is the department
into which they seem to have thrown their intellect most
effectively for the last ten or fifteen years.&nbsp; We are
reading Whewell&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of the Inductive
Sciences,&rdquo; which gives one a summary of what has been
accomplished in that way, not only in past ages, but in the
present.&nbsp; Every moment here is precious to me and I am
anxious to make the best use of it, but I have immense demands on
my time in every way.</p>
<h3><i>To W. D. B. and A. B.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Tuesday night, January 19, 1847.</p>
<p>To-day we have been present at the opening of Parliament, but
how can I picture to you the interest and magnificence of the
scene.&nbsp; I will begin quite back, and give you all the
preparations for a &ldquo;Court Day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ten days
before, a note was written to Lord Willoughby d&rsquo;Eresby,
informing him of my intention to attend, that a seat might be
reserved for me, and also soliciting several tickets for American
ladies and gentlemen. . . .&nbsp; I cannot take them with me,
however, as the seat assigned to the ladies of Foreign Ministers
is very near the throne.&nbsp; This morning when I awoke the fog
was thicker than I ever knew it, even here.&nbsp; The air was one
dense orange-colored mass.&nbsp; What a pity the English cannot
borrow our bright blue skies in which to exhibit their royal
pageants!</p>
<p>Mr. Bancroft&rsquo;s court dress had not been sent home, our
servants&rsquo; liveries had not made their appearance, and our
carriage only arrived last night, and I had not passed judgment
upon it.&nbsp; Fogs and tradesmen! these are the torments of
London.&nbsp; Very soon came the tailor with embroidered dress,
sword, and chapeau, but, alas! Mr. Isidore, who was to have
dressed my hair at half-past ten was not forthcoming, and to
complete my perplexity, he had my head-dress in his
possession.&nbsp; At last, just as Russell had resumed her office
at the toilet, came Isidore, a little before twelve, coiffure and
all, which was so pretty that I quire forgave him all his
sins.&nbsp; It was of green leaves and white <i>fleur-de-lis</i>,
with a white ostrich feather drooping on one side.&nbsp; I wear
my hair now plain in front, and the wreath was very flat and
classical in its style.&nbsp; My dress was black velvet with a
very rich bertha.&nbsp; A bouquet on the front of
<i>fleur-de-lis</i>, like the coiffure, and a Cashmere shawl,
completed my array.&nbsp; I have had the diamond pin and earrings
which you father gave me, reset, and made into a magnificent
brooch, and so arranged that I can also wear it as a necklace or
bracelet.&nbsp; On this occasion it was my necklace.</p>
<p>Miss Murray came to go with me, as she wished to be by my side
to point out everybody, and her badge as Maid of Honor would take
her to any part of the house.&nbsp; At half-past twelve she and I
set out, and after leaving us the carriage returned for your
father and Mr. Brodhead.&nbsp; But first let me tell you
something of our equipage.&nbsp; It is a <i>chariot</i>, not a
coach; that is, it has but one seat, but the whole front being
glass makes it much more agreeable to such persons as have not
large families.&nbsp; The color is maroon, with a silver
moulding, and has the American arms on the panel.&nbsp; The
liveries are blue and red; on Court Days they have blue plush
breeches, and white silk stockings, with buckles on their
shoes.&nbsp; Your father leaves all these matters to me, and they
have given me no little plague.&nbsp; When I thought I had
arranged everything necessary, the coachman, good old Brooks,
solicited an audience a day or two ago, and began,
&ldquo;Mistress, did you tell them to send the pads and the
fronts and the hand-pieces?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heavens and
earth! what are all these things?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am, we always has pads under the saddle on
Court Days, trimmed round with the colors of the livery, and we
has fronts made of ribbin for the horses&rsquo; heads, and we has
white hand-pieces for the reins.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is a specimen
of the little troubles of court life, but it has its
compensations.&nbsp; To go back to Miss Murray and myself, who
are driving through the park between files of people, thousands
and thousands all awaiting with patient, loyal faces the passage
of the Queen and of the State carriages.&nbsp; The Queen&rsquo;s
was drawn by eight cream-colored horses, and the servants flaming
with scarlet and gold.&nbsp; This part of the park, near the
palace, is only accessible to the carriages of the foreign
ministers, ministers, and officers of the household.</p>
<p>We arrive at the Parliament House, move through the long
corridor and give up our tickets at the door of the
chamber.&nbsp; It is a very long, narrow room.&nbsp; At the upper
end is the throne, on the right is the seat of the ambassadors,
on the left, of their ladies.&nbsp; Just in front of the throne
is the wool-sack of the Lord Chancellor, looking like a
drawing-room divan, covered with crimson velvet.&nbsp; Below this
are rows of seats for the judges, who are all in their wigs and
scarlet robes; the bishops and the peers, all in robes of scarlet
and ermine.&nbsp; Opposite the throne at the lower end is the Bar
of the Commons.&nbsp; On the right of the Queen&rsquo;s chair is
a vacant one, on which is carved the three plumes, the insignia
of the Prince of Wales, who will occupy it when he is seven or
nine years old; on the left Prince Albert sits.</p>
<p>The seat assigned me was in the front row, and quite open,
like a sofa, so that I could talk with any gentleman whom I
knew.&nbsp; Madam Van de Weyer was on one side of me and the
Princess Callimachi on the other, and Miss Murray just behind
me.&nbsp; She insisted on introducing to me all her noble
relatives.&nbsp; Her cousin, the young Duke of Athol; the Duke of
Buccleuch; her nephew the Marquis of Camden; her brother the
Bishop of Rochester.&nbsp; There were many whom I had seen
before, so that the hour passed very agreeably.&nbsp; Very soon
came in the Duke of Cambridge, at which everybody rose, he being
a royal duke.&nbsp; He was dressed in the scarlet kingly robe,
trimmed with ermine, and with his white hair and whiskers (he is
an old man) was most picturesque and scenic, reminding me of King
Lear and other stage kings.&nbsp; He requested to be introduced
to me, upon which I rose, of course.&nbsp; He soon said,
&ldquo;Be seated,&rdquo; and we went on with the
conversation.&nbsp; I told him how much I liked Kew Garden, where
he has a favorite place.</p>
<p>When I first entered I was greeted very cordially by a
personage in a black gown and wig, whom I did not know.&nbsp; He
laughed and said: &ldquo;I am Mr. Senior, whom you saw only
Saturday evening, but you do not know me in my wig.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is, indeed, an entire transformation, for it reaches down on
the shoulders.&nbsp; He is a master in chancery.&nbsp; He stood
by me nearly all the time and pointed out many of the judges, and
some persons not in Miss Murray&rsquo;s line.</p>
<p>But the trumpets sound! the Queen approaches!&nbsp; The
trumpet continues, and first enter at a side door close at my
elbow the college of heralds richly dressed, slowly, two and two;
then the great officers of the household, then the Lord
Chancellor bearing the purse, seal, and speech of the Queen, with
the macebearers before him.&nbsp; Then Lord Lansdowne with the
crown, the Earl of Zetland, with the cap of maintenance, and the
Duke off Wellington, with the sword of State.&nbsp; Then Prince
Albert, leading the Queen, followed by the Duchess of Sutherland,
Mistress of the Robes, and the Marchioness of Douro,
daughter-in-law of the Duke of Wellington, who is one of the
ladies in waiting.&nbsp; The Queen and Prince sit down, while
everybody else remains standing.&nbsp; The Queen then says in a
voice most clear and sweet: &ldquo;My lords (rolling the r), be
seated.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon which the peers sit down, except those
who enter with the Queen, who group themselves about the throne
in the most picturesque manner.&nbsp; The Queen had a crown of
diamonds, with splendid necklace and stomacher of the same.&nbsp;
The Duchess of Sutherland close by her side with her ducal
coronet of diamonds, and a little back, Lady Douro, also, with
her coronet.&nbsp; On the right of the throne stood the Lord
Chancellor, with scarlet robe and flowing wig, holding the
speech, surrounded by the emblems of his office; a little
farther, one step lower down, Lord Lansdowne, holding the crown
on a crimson velvet cushion, and on the left the Duke of
Wellington, brandishing the sword of State in the air, with the
Earl of Zetland by his side.&nbsp; The Queen&rsquo;s train of
royal purple, or rather deep crimson, was borne by many
train-bearers.&nbsp; The whole scene seemed to me like a dream or
a vision.&nbsp; After a few minutes the Lord Chancellor came
forward and presented the speech to the Queen.&nbsp; She read it
sitting and most exquisitely.&nbsp; Her voice is flute-like and
her whole emphasis decided and intelligent.&nbsp; Very soon after
the speech is finished she leaves the House, and we all follow,
as soon as we can get our carriages.</p>

<p>Lord Lansdowne told me before she came in that the speech
would be longer than usual, &ldquo;but not so long as your
President&rsquo;s speeches.&rdquo;&nbsp; It has been a day of
high pleasure and more like a romance than a reality to me, and
being in the very midst of it as I was, made it more striking
than if I had looked on from a distant gallery.</p>
<h3><i>To W. D. B. and A. B.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
February 7, 1847.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sons</span>: . . . On Friday we
dined with two bachelors, Mr. Peabody and Mr. Coates, who are
American bankers.&nbsp; Mr. Peabody is a friend of Mr. Corcoran
and was formerly a partner of Mr. Riggs in Baltimore.&nbsp; Mr.
Coates is of Boston. . . . They mustered up all the Americans
that could be found, and we dined with twenty-six of our
countrymen.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Monday Morning.</p>
<p>Last evening we were at home to see any Americans who might
chance to come. . . . I make tea in the drawing-room, on a little
table with a white cloth, which would not be esteemed <i>comme il
faut</i> with us.&nbsp; There is none of the parade of eating in
the largest evening party here.&nbsp; I see nothing but tea, and
sometimes find an informal refreshment table in the room where we
put on our cloaks.</p>
<p>I got a note yesterday from the O&rsquo;Connor Don, enclosing
an order to admit me to the House of Commons on Monday. . . . You
will be curious to know who is &ldquo;The O&rsquo;Connor
Don.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is Dennis O&rsquo;Connor, Esq., but is of
the oldest family in Ireland, and the representative of the last
kings of Connaught.&nbsp; He is called altogether the
O&rsquo;Connor Don, and begins his note to me with that
title.&nbsp; You remember Campbell&rsquo;s poem of
&ldquo;O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s Child&rdquo;?</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Sunday, 14th February.</p>
<p>. . . Yesterday morning was my breakfast at Sir Robert
Inglis&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The hour was halfpast nine, and as his
house is two miles off I had to be up wondrous early for
me.&nbsp; The weather has been very cold for this climate for the
last few days, though we should think it moderate.&nbsp; They
know nothing of extreme cold here.&nbsp; But, to return to or
breakfast, where, notwithstanding the cold, the guests were
punctually assembled: The Marquis of Northampton and his sisters,
the Bishop of London with his black apron, Sir Stratford Canning,
Mr. Rutherford, Lord Advocate for Scotland, the Solicitor-General
and one or two others.&nbsp; The conversation was very agreeable
and I enjoyed my first specimen of an English breakfast
exceedingly. . . . Our invitations jostle each other, now
Parliament has begun, for everybody invites on Wednesday,
Saturday, or Sunday, when there are no debates.&nbsp; We had
three dinner invitations for next Wednesday, from Mr. Harcourt,
Marquis of Anglesey, and Mrs. Mansfield.&nbsp; We go to the
former.&nbsp; The Queen held a lev&eacute;e on Friday, for
gentlemen only.&nbsp; Your father went, of course.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: right">Sunday, February 21st.</p>
<p>I left off on Sunday, on which day I got a note from Lady
Morgan, saying that she wished us to come and meet some
agreeables at her house. . . . There I met Sir William and Lady
Molesworth, Sir Benjamin Hall, etc., and had a long talk with
&ldquo;E&#333;then,&rdquo; who is a quiet, unobtrusive person in
manner, though his book is quite an effervescence. . . . On
Wednesday we dined with Mr. Harcourt, and met there Lord
Brougham, who did the talking chiefly, Lord and Lady Mahon, Mr.
Labouchere, etc.&nbsp; It was a most agreeable party, and we were
very glad to meet Lord Brougham, whom we had not before seen.</p>
<p>Lord Brougham is entertaining, and very much listened
to.&nbsp; Indeed, the English habit seems to be to suffer a few
people to do up a great part of the talking, such as Macaulay,
Brougham, and Sydney Smith and Mackintosh in their day. . . . On
Saturday evening, at ten o&rsquo;clock, we went to a little party
at Lady Stratheden&rsquo;s.&nbsp; After staying there
three-quarters of an hour we went to Lady Palmerston&rsquo;s,
where were all the <i>great</i> London world, the Duchess of
Sutherland among the number.&nbsp; She is most noble, and at the
same time lovely. . . . We had an autograph note from Sir Robert
Peel, inviting us to dine next Saturday, and were engaged.&nbsp;
I hope they will ask us again, for I know few things better than
to see him, as we should in dining there.&nbsp; I have the same
interest in seeing the really distinguished men of England, that
I should have in the pictures and statues of Rome, and indeed,
much greater.&nbsp; I wish I was better prepared for my life here
by a more extensive culture; mere fine ladyism will not do, or
prosy bluism, but one needs for a thorough enjoyment of society,
a healthy, practical, and extensive culture, and a use of the
modern languages in our position would be convenient.&nbsp; I do
not know how a gentleman can get on without it here, and I find
it so desirable that I devote a good deal of time to speaking
French with Louisa&rsquo;s governess.&nbsp; Your father uses
French a great deal with his colleagues, who, many of them, speak
English with great difficulty, and some not at all. . . . Lady
Charlotte Lindsay came one day this week to engage us to dine
with her on Wednesday, but yesterday she came to say that she
wanted Lord Brougham to meet us, and he could not come till
Friday.&nbsp; Fortunately we had no dinner engagement on that
day, and we are to meet also the Miss Berrys; Horace
Walpole&rsquo;s Miss Berrys, who with Lady Charlotte herself, are
the last remnants of the old school here.</p>
<h3><i>To I. P. D.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right">February 21st.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Uncle</span>: . . . I wrote [J.
D.] a week or two before I heard of his death, but was unable to
tell him anything of Lord North, as I had not met Lady Charlotte
Lindsay.&nbsp; I have seen her twice this week at Baron
Parke&rsquo;s and at Lord Campbell&rsquo;s, and told her how much
I had wished to do so before, and on what account.&nbsp; She says
her father heard reading with great pleasure, and that one of her
sisters could read the classics: Latin and, I think, Greek, which
he enjoyed to the last.&nbsp; She says that he never complained
of losing his sight, but that her mother has told her that it
worried him in his old age that he remained Minister during our
troubles at a period when he wished, himself, to resign.&nbsp; He
sometimes talked of it in the solitude of sleepless nights, her
mother has told her.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning we were invited by Dr. Buckland, the Dean
of Westminster, to go to his house, and from thence to the Abbey,
to witness the funeral of the Duke of Northumberland.&nbsp; The
Dean, who has control of everything in the Abbey, issued tickets
to several hundred persons to go and witness the funeral, but
only Lord Northampton&rsquo;s family, the Bunsens (the Prussian
Minister), and ourselves, went to his house, and into the
Dean&rsquo;s little gallery.</p>
<p>After the ceremony there were a crowd of visitors at the
Dean&rsquo;s, and I met many old acquaintances, and made many new
ones, among whom were Lady Chantrey, a nice person.&nbsp; After
the crowd cleared off, we sat down to a long table at lunch,
always an important meal here, and afterward the Dean took me on
his arm and showed me everything within the Abbey
precincts.&nbsp; He took us first to the Percy Chapel to see the
vault of the Percys. . . . From thence the Dean took us to the
Jerusalem chamber where Henry IV died, then all over the
Westminster school.&nbsp; We first went to the hall where the
young men were eating their dinner. . . . We then went to the
school-room, where every inch of the wall and benches is covered
with names, some of them most illustrious, as
Dryden&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There were two bunches of rods, which the
Dean assured me were not mere symbols of power, but were daily
used, as, indeed, the broken twigs scattered upon the floor
plainly showed.&nbsp; Our ferules are thought rather barbarous,
but a gentle touch from a slender twig not at all so.&nbsp; These
young men looked to me as old as our collegians.&nbsp; We then
went to their study-rooms, play-rooms, and sleeping-rooms.&nbsp;
The whole forty sleep in one long and well-ventilated room, the
walls of which were also covered with names.&nbsp; At the foot of
each bed was a large chest covered with leather, as mouldering
and time-worn as the Abbey itself.&nbsp; Here are educated the
sons of some of the noblest families, and the Archbishop of York
has had six sons here, and all of them were in succession the
Captain of the school. . . .</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening we went first to our friends, the
Bunsens, where we were invited to meet the Duchess of Sutherland
with a few other persons.&nbsp; Bunsen is very popular
here.&nbsp; He is learned and accomplished, and was so much
praised in the Biography of Dr. Arnold, the late historian of
Rome, that he has great reputation in the world of letters. . . .
Although we have great pleasure in the society of Chevalier and
Madam Bunsen, and in those whom we meet at their house.&nbsp; On
this occasion we only stayed half an hour, which I passed in
talking with the Bishop of Norwich and his wife, Mrs. Stanley,
and went to Lady Morgan&rsquo;s without waiting till the Duchess
of Sutherland came.&nbsp; There we found her little rooms full of
agreeable people. . . . The next day, Thursday, there was a grand
opera for the benefit of the Irish, and all the Diplomatic Corps
were obliged to take boxes.&nbsp; Lady Palmerston, who was one of
the three patronesses, secured a very good box for us, directly
opposite the Queen, and only three from the stage.</p>
<p>We took with us Mrs. Milman and W. T. Davis, to whom it gave a
grand opportunity of seeing the Queen and the assembled
aristocracy, at least all who are now in London.&nbsp; &ldquo;God
save the Queen,&rdquo; sung with the whole audience standing, was
a noble sight.&nbsp; The Queen also stood, and at the end gave
three curtsies.&nbsp; On Friday Captain and Mrs. Wormeley, with
Miss Wormeley, dined with us, with Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle, Miss
Murray, the Maid of Honor, Mr. and Mrs. Pell of New York, with
William T. and Mr. Brodhead.&nbsp; William was very glad to see
Carlyle, who showed himself off to perfection, uttering his
paradoxes in broad Scotch.</p>
<p>Last evening we dined at Mr. Thomas Baring&rsquo;s, and a most
agreeable dinner it was.&nbsp; The company consisted of twelve
persons, Lord and Lady Ashburton, etc.&nbsp; I like Lady
Ashburton extremely.&nbsp; She is full of intelligence, reads
everything, talks most agreeably, and still loves America.&nbsp;
She is by no means one of those who abjure their country.&nbsp; I
have seen few persons in England whom I should esteem a more
delightful friend or companion than Lady Ashburton, and I do not
know why, but I had received a different impression of her.&nbsp;
Lord Ashburton, by whom I sat at dinner, struck me as still one
of the wisest men I have seen in England.&nbsp; Lady Ashburton,
who was sitting by Mr. Bancroft, leant forward and said to her
husband, &ldquo;<i>We</i> can bring bushels of corn this year to
England.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who do you mean by <i>we</i>?&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, we Americans, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: right">Monday Evening.</p>
<p>Yesterday we dined at Count St. Aulair&rsquo;s, the French
Ambassador, who is a charming old man of the old French school,
at a sort of amicable dinner given to Lord and Lady
Palmerston.&nbsp; Lord John Russell was of the party, with the
Russian Ambassador and lady, Mr. and Madam Van de Weyer, the
Prussian and Turkish Ministers.&nbsp; The house of the French
Embassy is fine, but these formal grand dinners are not so
charming as the small ones.&nbsp; The present state of feeling
between Lord Palmerston and the French Government gave it a kind
of interest, however, and it certainly went off in a much better
spirit than Lady Normanby&rsquo;s famous party, which Guizot
would not attend.&nbsp; It seems very odd to me to be in the
midst of these European affairs, which I have all my life looked
upon from so great a distance.</p>
<h3><i>To Mrs. W. W. Story</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
March 23, 1847.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Story</span>: I should have
thanked you by the last steamer for your note and the charming
volume which accompanied it, but my thoughts and feelings were so
much occupied by the sad tidings I heard from my own family that
I wrote to no one out of it.&nbsp; The poems, which would at all
times have given me great pleasure, gave me still more here than
they would if I were with you on the other side of the
Atlantic.&nbsp; I am not cosmopolitan enough to love any nature
so well as our American nature, and in addition to the charm of
its poetry, every piece brought up to me the scenes amidst which
it had been written. . . . How dear these associations are your
husband will soon know when he too is separated from his native
shores and from those he loves. . . . I shall look forward with
great pleasure to seeing him here, and only wish you were to
accompany him, for your own sake, for his, and for ours.&nbsp;
His various culture will enable him to enjoy most fully all that
Europe can yield him in every department.&nbsp; My own regret
ever since I have been here has been that the seed has not
&ldquo;fallen upon better ground,&rdquo; for though I thought
myself not ignorant wholly, I certainly lose much that I might
enjoy more keenly if I were better prepared for it.&nbsp; I envy
the pleasure which Mr. Story will receive from music, painting,
and sculpture in Europe, even if he were destitute of the
creative inspiration which he will take with him.&nbsp; For
ourselves, we have everything to make us happy here, and I should
be quite so, if I could forget that I had a country and children
with very dear friends 3,000 miles away. . . . There are certain
sympathies of country which one cannot overcome.&nbsp; On the
other hand I certainly enjoy pleasures of the highest kind, and
am every day floated like one in a dream into the midst of
persons and scenes that make my life seem more like a drama than
a reality.&nbsp; Nothing is more unreal than the actual presence
of persons of whom one has heard much, and long wished to
see.&nbsp; One day I find myself at dinner by the side of Sir
Robert Peel, another by Lord John Russell, or at Lord
Lansdowne&rsquo;s table, with Mrs. Norton, or at a charming
breakfast with Mr. Rogers, surrounded by pictures and marbles, or
with tall feathers and a long train, making curtsies to a
queen.</p>

<h3><i>To W. D. B. and A. B.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
April 2 [1847].</p>
<p>Here it is the day before the despatches leave and I have not
written a single line to you. . . . On Friday we dined at Lady
Charlotte Lindsay&rsquo;s, where were Lord Brougham and Lady
Mallet, Mr. Rogers and the Bishop of Norwich and his wife.&nbsp;
In the evening Miss Agnes Berry, who never goes out now, came on
purpose to appoint an evening to go and see her sister, who is
the one that Horace Walpole wished to marry, and to whom so many
of his later letters are addressed.&nbsp; She is eighty-four, her
sister a few years younger, and Lady Charlotte not much their
junior.</p>
<p>These remnants of the <i>belles-esprits</i> of the last age
are charming to me.&nbsp; They have a vast and long experience of
the best social circles, with native wit, and constant practice
in the conversation of society. . . . On Wednesday, we dined at
Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s, with whom I was more charmed than with
anybody I have seen yet.&nbsp; I sat between him and the Speaker
of the House of Commons.&nbsp; I was told that he was stiff and
stately in his manners, but did not think him so, and am inclined
to imagine that free from the burden of the Premiership, he
unbends more.&nbsp; He talked constantly with me, and in speaking
of a certain picture said, &ldquo;When you come to Drayton Manor
I shall show it to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; I should like to go there,
but to see himself even more than his pictures.&nbsp; Lady Peel
is still a very handsome woman.</p>
<p>The next morning we breakfasted with Mr. Rogers.&nbsp; He
lives, as you probably know, in [a] beautiful house, though
small, whose rooms look upon the Green Park, and filled with
pictures and marbles.&nbsp; We stayed an hour or more after the
other guests, listening to his stores of literary anecdote and
pleasant talk.&nbsp; In the evening we went to the Miss
Berrys&rsquo;, where we found Lord Morpeth, who is much attached
to them.&nbsp; Miss Berry put her hand on his head, which is
getting a little gray, and said: &ldquo;Ah, George, and I
remember the day you were born, your grandmother brought you and
put you in my arms.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now this grandmother of Lord
Morpeth&rsquo;s was the celebrated Duchess of Devonshire, who
electioneered for Fox, and he led her to tell me all about
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eothen&rdquo; was also there, Lady Lewis and
many of my friends. . . . Aunty wishes to know who is
&ldquo;Eothen.&rdquo;&nbsp; She has probably read his book,
&ldquo;Eothen, or Traces of Travel,&rdquo; which was very popular
two or three years since.&nbsp; He is a young lawyer, Mr.
Kinglake, the most modest, unassuming person in his manners, very
shy and altogether very unlike the dashing, spirited young
Englishman I figured to myself, whom nothing could daunt from the
Arab even to the plague, which he defied.</p>

<h3><i>To I. P. D.</i></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Uncle and Aunt</span>: On Thursday
[the 25th] we were invited to Sir John Pakington&rsquo;s, whose
wife is the Bishop of Rochester&rsquo;s daughter, but were
engaged to Mr. Senior, who had asked us to meet the Archbishop of
Dublin, the celebrated Dr. Whately.&nbsp; He had come over from
Ireland to make a speech in the House of Lords upon the Irish
Poor Law.&nbsp; He is full of learning [and] simplicity, and with
most genial hearty manners.&nbsp; Rogers was also there and said
more fine things than I have heard him say before at dinner, as
he is now so deaf that he does not hear general conversation, and
cannot tell where to send his shaft, which is always
pointed.&nbsp; He retains all his sarcasm and epigrammatic point,
but he shines now especially at breakfast, where he has his
audience to himself.</p>
<p>We went from Mr. Senior&rsquo;s to Mr. Milman&rsquo;s, but
nearly all the guests there were departed or departing, though
one or two returned with us to the drawing-room to stay the few
minutes we did.&nbsp; Among the lingerers we found Sir William
and Lady Duff Gordon, the two Warburtons, &ldquo;Hochelaga&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Crescent and Cross,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Eothen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Milman I really love, and we see
much of them.</p>
<p>On Saturday was the dreaded Drawing-Room, on which occasion I
was to be presented to the Queen. . . . Mr. Bancroft and I left
home at a quarter past one.&nbsp; On our arrival we passed
through one or two corridors, lined by attendants with
battle-axes and picturesque costumes, looking very much like the
supernumeraries on the stage, and were ushered into the
ante-room, a large and splendid room, where only the Ministers
and Privy Councillors, with their families, are allowed to go
with the Diplomatic Corps.&nbsp; Here we found Lady Palmerston,
who showed me a list she had got Sir Edward Cust, the master of
ceremonies, to make out of the order of precedence of the
Diplomatic Corps, and when the turn would come for us who were to
be newly presented.&nbsp; The room soon filled up and it was like
a pleasant party, only more amusing, as the costumes of both
gentlemen and ladies were so splendid.&nbsp; I got a seat in the
window with Madam Van de Weyer and saw the Queen&rsquo;s train
drive up.&nbsp; At the end of this room are two doors: at the
left hand everybody enters the next apartment where the Queen and
her suite stand, and after going round the circle, come out at
the right-hand door.&nbsp; After those who are privileged to go
<i>first</i> into the <i>ante-room</i> leave it, the general
circle pass in, and they also go in and out the same doors.&nbsp;
But to go back.&nbsp; The left-hand door opens and Sir Edward
Cust leads in the Countess Dietrichstein, who is the eldest
Ambassadress, as the Countess St. Aulair is in Paris.&nbsp; As
she enters she drops her train and the gentlemen ushers open it
out like a peacock&rsquo;s tail.&nbsp; Then Madam Van de Weyer,
who comes next, follows close upon the train of the former, then
Baroness Brunnow, the Madam Bunsen, then Madam Lisboa, then Lady
Palmerston, who, as the wife of the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
is to introduce the Princess Callimachi, Baroness de Beust, and
myself.&nbsp; She stations herself by the side of the Queen and
names us as we pass.&nbsp; The Queen spoke to none of us, but
gave me a very gracious smile, and when Mr. Bancroft came by, she
said: &ldquo;I am very glad to have had the pleasure of seeing
Mrs. Bancroft to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was not [at] all frightened
and gathered up my train with as much self-possession as if I
were alone.&nbsp; I found it very entertaining afterward to watch
the reception of the others.&nbsp; The Diplomatic Corps remain
through the whole, the ladies standing on the left of the Queen
and the gentlemen in the centre, but all others pass out
immediately. . . . On Sunday evening Mr. Bancroft set off for
Paris to pass the Easter recess of Parliament. . . . I got a very
interesting letter yesterday from Mr. Bancroft.&nbsp; It seems
that the Countess Circourt, whose husband has reviewed his book
and Prescott&rsquo;s, is a most charming person, and makes her
house one of the most brilliant and attractive in Paris.&nbsp;
Since he left, a note came from Mr. Hallam, the contents of which
pleased me as they will you.&nbsp; It announced that Mr. Bancroft
was chosen an Honorary Member of the Society of Antiquaries, of
which Lord Mahon is president, Hallam, vice-president.&nbsp;
Hallam says the society is very old and that he is the first
citizen of the United States upon whom it has been conferred, but
that he will not long possess it exclusively, as his
&ldquo;highly distinguished countryman, Mr. Prescott, has also
been proposed.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><i>To W. D. B. and A. B.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right">Tuesday.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sons</span>: . . . On Monday
morning came the dear Miss Berrys, to beg me to come that evening
to join their circle.&nbsp; They have always the best people in
London about them, young as well as old.</p>
<p>The old and the middle-aged are more attended to here than
with us, where the young are all in all.&nbsp; As Hayward said to
me the other evening, &ldquo;it takes time to make <i>people</i>,
like cathedrals,&rdquo; and Mr. Rogers and Miss Berry could not
have been what they are now, forty years ago.&nbsp; A long life
of experience in the midst constantly of the highest and most
cultivated circles, and with several generations of distinguished
men gives what can be acquired in no other way.&nbsp; Mr. Rogers
said to me one day: &ldquo;I have learnt more from men that from
<i>books</i>, and when I used to be in the society of Fox and
other great men of that period, and they would sometimes say
&lsquo;I have always thought so and so,&rsquo; then I have opened
my ears and listened, for I said to myself, now I shall get at
the treasured results of the experience of these great
men.&rdquo;&nbsp; This little saying of Mr. Rogers expresses
precisely my own feelings in the society of the venerable and
distinguished here.&nbsp; With us society is left more to the
crudities of the young than in England.&nbsp; The young may be
interesting and promise much, but they are still
<i>crude</i>.&nbsp; The elements, however fine, are not yet
completely assimilated and brought to that more perfect tone
which comes later in life.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">Monday, April 12th.</p>
<p>. . . On Saturday I went with Sir William and Lady Molesworth
to their box in the new Covent Garden opera, which has been
opened for the first time this week.&nbsp; There I saw Grisi and
Alboni and Tamburini in the &ldquo;Semiramide.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was a new world of delight to me.&nbsp; Grisi, so statuesque and
so graceful, delights the eye, the ear, and the soul.&nbsp; She
is sculpture, poetry, and music at the same time. . . . Mr.
Bancroft has been received with great cordiality in Paris.&nbsp;
He has been three times invited to the Palace, and Guizot and
Mignet give him access to all that he wants in the archives, and
he passes his evenings with all the eminent men and beautiful
women of Paris.&nbsp; Guizot, Thiers, Lamartine, Cousin,
Salvandi, Thierry, he sees, and enjoys all.&nbsp; They take him
to the salons, too, of the Faubourg St. Germain, among the old
French aristocracy, and to innumerable receptions.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Wednesday.</p>
<p>To-morrow I go to the Drawing-Room alone, and to complete the
climax, the Queen has sent us an invitation to dine at the Palace
to-morrow, and I must go <i>alone</i> for the <i>first
time</i>.&nbsp; If I live through it, I will tell you all about
it; but is it not awkward in the extreme?</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Friday Morning.</p>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening I drove to the
Palace.&nbsp; My dress was my currant-colored or grosseille
velvet with a wreath of white Arum lilies woven into a kind of
turban, with green leave and bouquet to match, on the bertha of
Brussels lace.&nbsp; I was received by a servant, who escorted me
through a long narrow corridor the length of Winthrop Place and
consigned me to another who escorted me in his turn, through
another wider corridor to the foot of a flight of stairs which I
ascended and found another servant, who took my cloak and showed
me into the grand corridor or picture gallery; a noble apartment
of interminable length; and surrounded by pictures of the best
masters.&nbsp; General Bowles, the Master of the Household, came
forward to meet me, and Lord Byron, who is one of the Lords in
Waiting.&nbsp; I found Madam Lisboa already arrived, and soon
came in Lord and Lady Palmerston, the Duke of Norfolk, the
Marquis and Marchioness of Exeter, Lord and Lady Dalhousie, Lord
Charles Wellesley, son of the Duke of Wellington, Lady Byron, and
Mr. Hallam.&nbsp; We sat and talked as at any other place, when
at last the Queen was announced.&nbsp; The gentlemen ranged
themselves on one side, and we on the other, and the Queen and
Prince passed through, she bowing, and we profoundly
curtseying.&nbsp; As soon as she passed the Marquis of Exeter
came over and took Madam Lisboa, and Lord Dalhousie came and took
me.&nbsp; The Queen and Prince sat in the middle of a long table,
and I was just opposite the Prince, between Lord Exeter and Lord
Dalhousie, who is the son of the former Governor of Nova Scotia,
was in the last ministry, and a most agreeable person.&nbsp; I
talked to my neighbors as at any other dinner, but the Queen
spoke to no one but Prince Albert, with a word or two to the Duke
of Norfolk, who was on her right, and is the first peer of the
realm.</p>
<p>The dinner was rather quickly despatched, and when the Queen
rose we followed her back into the corridor.&nbsp; She walked to
the fire and stood some minutes, and then advanced to me and
enquired about Mr. Bancroft, his visit to Paris, if he had been
there before, etc.&nbsp; I expressed, of course, the regret he
would feel at losing the honor of dining with Her Majesty,
etc.&nbsp; She then had a talk with Lady Palmerston, who stood by
my side, then with all the other ladies in succession, until at
last Prince Albert came out, soon followed by the other
gentlemen.&nbsp; The Prince then spoke to all the ladies, as she
had done, while she went in succession to all the gentlemen
guests.&nbsp; This took some time and we were obliged to stand
all the while.</p>
<p>At last the Queen, accompanied by her Lady in Waiting, Lady
Mount Edgcumbe, went to a sofa at the other end of the corridor
in front of which was a round table surrounded by
arm-chairs.&nbsp; When the Queen was seated Lady Mount Edgcumbe
came to us and requested us to take our seats round the
table.&nbsp; This was a little prim, for I did not know exactly
how much I might talk to others in the immediate presence of the
Queen, and everybody seemed a little constrained.&nbsp; She spoke
to us all, and very soon such of the gentlemen as were allowed by
their rank, joined us at the round table.&nbsp; Lord Dalhousie
came again to my side and I had as pleasant a conversation with
him, rather <i>sotto voce</i>, however, as I could have had at a
private house.&nbsp; At half-past ten the Queen rose and shook
hands with each lady; we curtsied profoundly, and she and the
Prince departed.&nbsp; We then bade each other good-night, and
found our carriages as soon as we chose.</p>
<h3><i>To W. D. B. and A. B.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
May 16, 1847.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sons</span>: My letters by this
steamer will have very little interest for you, as, from being in
complete retirement, I have no new things to related to you. . .
. We have taken advantage of our leisure to drive a little into
the country, and on Tuesday I had a pleasure of the highest order
in driving down to Esher and passing a quiet day with Lady Byron,
the widow of the poet.&nbsp; She is an intimate friend of Miss
Murray, who has long wished us to see her and desired her to name
the day for our visit.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Esher is a little village about sixteen miles from London, and
Lady Byron has selected it as her residence, though her estates
are in Leicestershire, because it is near Lord and Lady Lovelace,
her only child, the &ldquo;<i>Ada</i>&rdquo; of poetry.&nbsp; We
went in our own carriage, taking Miss Murray with us, and as the
country is now radiant with blossoms and glowing green, the drive
itself was very agreeable.&nbsp; We arrived at two o&rsquo;clock,
and found only Lady Byron, with the second boy of Lady Lovelace
and his tutor.&nbsp; Lady Byron is now about fifty-five, and with
the remains of an attractive, if not brilliant beauty.&nbsp; She
has extremely delicate features, and very pale and finely
delicate skin.&nbsp; A tone of voice and manner of the most
trembling refinement, with a culture and strong intellect, almost
masculine, but which betrays itself under such sweet and gentle
and unobtrusive forms that one is only led to perceive it by slow
degrees.&nbsp; She is the most modest and unostentatious person
one can well conceive.&nbsp; She lives simply, and the chief of
her large income (you know she was the rich Miss Milbank) she
devotes to others.&nbsp; After lunch she wished me to see a
little of the country round Esher and ordered her ponies and
small carriage for herself and me, while Mr. Bancroft and Miss
Murray walked.&nbsp; We went first to the royal seat, Claremont,
where the Princess Charlotte lived so happily with Leopold, and
where she died.&nbsp; Its park adjoins Lady Byron&rsquo;s, and
the Queen allows her a private key that she may enjoy its
exquisite grounds.&nbsp; Here we left the pedestrians, while Lady
Byron took me a more extensive drive, as she wished to show me
some of the heaths in the neighborhood, which are covered with
furze, now one mass of yellow bloom.</p>
<p>Every object is seen in full relief against the sky, and a
figure on horseback is peculiarly striking.&nbsp; I am always
reminded of the beginning of one of James&rsquo;s novels, which
is usually, you know, after this manner: &ldquo;It was toward the
close of a dull autumn day that two horsemen were seen,&rdquo;
etc., etc.&nbsp; Lady Byron took me to the estate of a
neighboring gentleman, to show me a fine old tower covered with
ivy, where Wolsey took refuge from his persecutors, with his
faithful follower, Cromwell.</p>
<p>Upon our return we found the last of the old harpers, blind,
and with a genuine old Irish harp, and after hearing his national
melodies for half an hour, taking a cup of coffee, and enjoying a
little more of Lady Byron&rsquo;s conversation, we departed,
having had a day heaped up with the richest and best
enjoyments.&nbsp; I could not help thinking, as I was walking up
and down the beautiful paths of Claremont Park, with the fresh
spring air blowing about me, the primroses, daisies, and wild
bluebells under my feet, and Lady Byron at my side, that it was
more like a page out of a poem than a reality.</p>
<p>On Sunday night any Americans who are here come to see us. . .
. Mr. Harding brought with him a gentleman, whom he introduced as
Mr. Alison.&nbsp; Mr. Bancroft asked him if he were related to
Archdeacon Alison, who wrote the &ldquo;Essay on
Taste.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am his son,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, then, you are the brother of the historian?&rdquo;
said Mr. Bancroft.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the historian,&rdquo; was
the reply. . . . An evening visitor is a thing unheard of, and
therefore my life is very lonely, now I do not go into
society.&nbsp; I see no one except Sunday evenings, and,
occasionally, a friend before dinner.</p>
<h3><i>To W. D. B. and A. B.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
May 24, [1847].</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sons</span>: . . . On Friday we
both went to see the Palace of Hampton Court with my dear, good,
Miss Murray, Mr. Winthrop and son, and Louise. . . . On our
arrival, we found, to our great vexation, that Friday was the
only day in the week in which visitors were not admitted, and
that we must content ourselves with seeing the grounds and go
back without a glimpse of its noble galleries of pictures.&nbsp;
Fortunately for us, Miss Murray had several friends among the
persons to whom the Queen has assigned apartments in the vast
edifice, and they willingly yielded their approbation of our
admission if she could possibly win over Mrs. Grundy, the
housekeeper.&nbsp; This name sounded rather inauspicious, but Mr.
Winthrop suggested that there might be a &ldquo;Felix&rdquo; to
qualify it, and so in this case it turned out.&nbsp; Mrs. Grundy
asserted that such a thing had never been done, that it was a
very dangerous precedent, etc., but in the end the weight of a
Maid of Honor and a Foreign Minister prevailed, and we saw
everything to much greater advantage than if we had 150 persons
following on, as Mr. Winthrop says he had the other day at
Windsor Castle. . . . On our way [home] we met Lady Byron with
her pretty little carriage and ponies.&nbsp; She alighted and we
did the same, and had quite a pleasant little interview in the
dusty road.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Sunday, May 30th.</p>
<p>Your father left town on Monday. . . . He did not return until
the 27th, the morning of the Queen&rsquo;s Birthday
Drawing-Room.&nbsp; On that occasion I went dressed in white
mourning. . . . It was a petticoat of white crape flounced to the
waist with the edges notched.&nbsp; A train of white glac&eacute;
trimmed with a ruche of white crape.&nbsp; A wreath and bouquet
of white lilacs, without any green, as green is not used in
mourning.&nbsp; The array of diamonds on this occasion was
magnificent in the highest degree, and everybody was in their
most splendid array.&nbsp; The next evening there was a concert
at the Palace, at which Jenny Lind, Grisi, Alboni, Mario, and
Tamburini sang.&nbsp; I went dressed in [a] deep black dress and
enjoyed the music highly.&nbsp; Seats were placed in rows in the
concert-room and one sat quietly as if in church.&nbsp; At the
end of the first part, the royal family with their royal guests,
the Grand Duke Constantine of Russia, and the Grand Duke and
Duchess of Saxe-Weimar went to the grand dining-room and supped
by themselves, with their suites, while another elegant
refreshment table was spread in another apartment for the other
guests. . . . Jenny Lind a little disappointed me, I must
confess, but they tell me that her songs were not adapted on that
evening to the display of her voice.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening your father dined with Baron Brunnow, the
Russian Minister, to meet the Grand Duke Constantine.&nbsp; It so
happened that the Grand Duke and Duchess of Saxe-Weimar appointed
an audience to Baron and Baroness Brunnow at seven, and they had
not returned at half-past seven, when the Grand Duke and their
other guests arrived.&nbsp; The Baroness immediately advanced to
the Grand Duke and sunk on her knees before him, asking pardon in
Russian.&nbsp; He begged her to rise, but she remained in the
attitude of deep humiliation, until the Grand Duke sunk also on
<i>his</i> knees and gently raised her, and then kissed her on
the cheek, a privilege, you know, of royalty.</p>
<p>. . . On Monday evening we both went to a concert at Mr.
Hudson&rsquo;s, the great railway &ldquo;king,&rdquo; who has
just made an immense fortune from railway stocks, and is now
desirous to get into society.&nbsp; These things are managed in a
curious way here.&nbsp; A <i>nouveau riche</i> gets several
ladies of fashion to patronize their entertainment and invite all
the guests.&nbsp; Our invitation was from Lady Parke, who wrote
me two notes about it, saying that she would be happy to meet me
at Mrs. Hudson&rsquo;s splendid mansion, where would be the best
music and society of London; and, true enough, there was the Duke
of Wellington and all the world.&nbsp; Lady Parke stood at the
entrance of the splendid suite of rooms to receive the guests and
introduce them to their host and hostess.&nbsp; On Tuesday
morning I got a note from Mr. Eliot Warburton (brother of
&ldquo;Hochelaga&rdquo;) to come to his room at two o&rsquo;clock
and look at some drawings.&nbsp; To our surprise we found quite a
party seated at lunch, and a collection of many agreeable persons
and some lions and lionesses.&nbsp; There was Lord Ross, the
great astronomer; Baroness Rothschild, a lovely Jewess; Miss
Strickland, the authoress of the &ldquo;Queens of England&rdquo;;
&ldquo;E&#333;then,&rdquo; and many more.&nbsp; Mr. Polk,
<i>Charg&eacute;</i> at Naples, and brother of the President,
dined with us, and Miss Murray, and in the evening came Mr. and
Mrs. McLean, he a son of Judge McLean, of Ohio.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">June 17th.</p>
<p>On Friday evening we went to the Queen&rsquo;s Ball, and for
the first time saw Her Majesty dance, which she does very well,
and so does the Duchess of Sutherland, grandmother though she
be.</p>
<p>On Monday evening we went to a concert given to the Queen by
the Duke of Wellington at Apsley House.&nbsp; This was an
occasion not to be forgotten, but I cannot describe it.&nbsp; On
Tuesday I went for the first time to hear a debate upon the
Portugal interference in the House of Lords.&nbsp; It brought out
all the leaders, and I was so fortunate as to hear a most
powerful speech from Lord Stanley, one from Lord Lansdowne in
defence of the Ministry and one from the Duke of Wellington, who,
on this occasion, sided with the Ministers.&nbsp; On Wednesday
was the great <i>f&ecirc;te</i> given by the Duchess of
Sutherland to the Queen.&nbsp; It was like a chapter of a fairy
tale.&nbsp; Persons from all the courts of Europe who were there
told us that nowhere in Europe was there anything as fine as the
hall and grand staircase where the Duchess received her
guests.&nbsp; It exceeded my utmost conceptions of magnificence
and beauty.&nbsp; The vast size of the apartment, the vaulted
ceilings, the arabesque ornaments, the fine pictures, the
profusion of flowers, the music, the flourish of trumpets, as the
Queen passed backward and forward, the superb dresses and
diamonds of the women, the parti-colored full dress of the
gentlemen all contributed to make up a scene not to be
forgotten.&nbsp; The Queen&rsquo;s Ball was not to be compared to
it, so much more effective is Stafford House than Buckingham
Palace. . . . We were fortunate to be present there, for Stafford
House is not opened in this way but once in a year or two, and
the Duke&rsquo;s health is now so very uncertain, that it may be
many years before it happens again.&nbsp; He was not present the
other evening.</p>
<h3><i>To Mr. and Mrs. I. P. D.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
June 20, 1847.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Uncle and Aunt</span>: On the
19th, Saturday, we breakfasted with Lady Byron and my friend,
Miss Murray, at Mr. Rogers&rsquo;.&nbsp; He and Lady Byron had
not met for many, many years, and their renewal of old friendship
was very interesting to witness.&nbsp; Mr. Rogers told me that he
first introduced her to Lord Byron.&nbsp; After breakfast he had
been repeating some lines of poetry which he thought fine, when
he suddenly exclaimed: &ldquo;But there is a bit of American
<i>prose</i>, which, I think, had more poetry in it than almost
any modern verse.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then repeated, I should think,
more than a page from Dana&rsquo;s &ldquo;Two Years Before the
Mast,&rdquo; describing the falling overboard of one of the crew,
and the effect it produced, not only at the moment, but for some
time afterward.&nbsp; I wondered at his memory, which enabled him
to recite so beautifully a long prose passage, so much more
difficult than verse.&nbsp; Several of those present with whom
the book was a favorite, were so glad to hear from me that it was
as <i>true</i> as interesting, for they had regarded it as partly
a work of imagination.&nbsp; Lady Byron had told Mr. Rogers when
she came in that Lady Lovelace, her daughter (Ada) wished also to
pay him a visit, and would come after breakfast to join us for
half an hour.&nbsp; She also had not seen Rogers, I
<i>believe</i>, ever.&nbsp; Lady Lovelace joined us soon after
breakfast, and as we were speaking of the enchantment of Stafford
House on Wednesday evening, Mr. Rogers proposed to go over it and
see its fine pictures by daylight.&nbsp; He immediately went
himself by a short back passage through the park to ask
permission and returned with all the eagerness and gallantry of a
young man to say that he had obtained it.&nbsp; We had thus an
opportunity of seeing, in the most leisurely way and in the most
delightful society, the fine pictures and noble apartments of
Stafford House again.</p>
<p>. . . On Tuesday Mr. Hallam took us to the British Museum, and
being a director, he could enter on a private day, when we were
not annoyed by a crowd, and, moreover, we had the advantage of
the best interpreters and guides.&nbsp; We did not even enter the
library, which requires a day by itself, but confined ourselves
to the Antiquity rooms. . . . As I entered the room devoted to
the Elgin marbles, the works of the &ldquo;divine Phidias,&rdquo;
I stepped with awe, as if entering a temple, and the Secretary,
who was by my side, observing it, told me that the Grand Duke
Constantine, when he came a few days before, made, as he entered,
a most profound and reverential bow.&nbsp; This was one of my
most delightful mornings, and I left the Antiquities with a
stronger desire to see them again than before I had seen them at
all.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Sunday, June 27th.</p>
<p>. . . I went on Wednesday to dine at Lord Monteagle&rsquo;s to
meet Father Mathew, and the Archbishop of Dublin (Dr. Whately)
also dined there.&nbsp; Father Mathew spoke with great interest
of America and of American liberality, and is very anxious to go
to our country.&nbsp; He saw Mr. Forbes at Cork and spoke of him
with great regard. . . . On [Saturday] Mr. Bancroft went to the
palace to see the King of the Belgians, with the rest of the
Diplomatic Corps.&nbsp; After his return we went to Westminster
Hall to see the prize pictures, as Lord Lansdowne had sent us
tickets for the private view.&nbsp; The Commission of Fine Arts
have offered prizes for the best historical pictures that may
serve to adorn the new Houses of Parliament, and the pictures of
this collection were all painted with that view.&nbsp; One of
those which have received a prize is John Robinson bestowing his
farewell blessing upon the Pilgrims at Leyden, which is very
pleasing.&nbsp; It was to me like a friend in a strange country,
and I lingered over it the longest.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">July 2d.</p>
<p>Wednesday [evening] we went to Lady Duff Gordon&rsquo;s, who
is the daughter of Mrs. Austin, where was a most agreeable party,
and among others, Andersen, the Danish poet-author of the
&ldquo;Improvisatore.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has a most striking
poetical physiognomy, but as he talked only German or bad French,
I left him to Mr. Bancroft in the conversation way.</p>
<p>The next morning before nine o&rsquo;clock we were told that
Mr. Rogers, the poet, was downstairs.&nbsp; I could not imagine
what had brought him out so early, but found that Moore, the
poet, had come to town and would stay but a day, and we must go
that very morning and breakfast with him at ten
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; We went and found a delightful circle.&nbsp;
I sat between Moore and Rogers, who was in his very best
humor.&nbsp; Moore is but a wreck, but most a interesting
one.</p>
<h3><i>To Mr. and Mrs. I. P. D.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Nuneham
Park</span>, July 27, 1847.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Uncle and Aunt</span>: . . . I
must go back to the day when my last letters were despatched, as
my life since has been full of interest.&nbsp; On Monday evening,
the 19th, we went to the French play, to see Rachel in
&ldquo;Ph&egrave;dre.&rdquo;&nbsp; She far surpassed my
imagination in the expression of all the powerful passions. . . .
On Tuesday Mr. Bancroft went down to hear Lord John make a speech
to his constituents in the city, while I went to see Miss
Burdett-Coutts lay the corner-stone of the church which
&ldquo;the Bishop of London has permitted her to build,&rdquo; to
use her own expression in her note to me.&nbsp; In the evening we
dined there with many of the clergy, and Lord Brougham, Lord
Dundonald, etc.&nbsp; I went down with the Dean of Westminster,
who was very agreeable and instructive.&nbsp; He and Dr. Whately
have the simplicity of children, with an immense deal of
knowledge, which they impart in the most pleasant way.&nbsp;
Saturday, the 24th, we were to leave town for our first country
excursion.&nbsp; We were invited by Dr. Hawtrey, the Head Master
of Eton, to be present at the ceremonies accompanying the annual
election of such boys on the Foundation as are selected to go up
to King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, where they are also placed on
a Foundation.&nbsp; From reading Dr. Arnold&rsquo;s life you will
have learned that the head master of one of these very great
schools is no unimportant personage.&nbsp; Dr. Hawtrey has an
income of six or seven thousand pounds.&nbsp; He is unmarried,
but has two single sisters who live with him, and his
establishment in one of the old college houses is full of
elegance and comfort.&nbsp; We took an open travelling carriage
with imperials, and drove down to Eton with our own horses,
arriving about one o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; At two, precisely, the
Provost of King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, was to arrive, and to
be received under the old gateway of the cloister by the Captain
of the school with a Latin speech.&nbsp; After dinner there is a
regatta among the boys, which is one of the characteristic and
pleasing old customs.&nbsp; All the fashionables of London who
have sons at Eton come down to witness their happiness, and the
river bank is full of gayety.&nbsp; The evening finished with the
most beautiful fireworks I ever saw, which lighted up the Castle
behind and were reflected in the Thames below, while the glancing
oars of the young boatmen, and the music of their band with a
merry chime of bells from St. George&rsquo;s Chapel, above, all
combined to give gayety and interest to the scene.&nbsp; The next
morning (Sunday), after an agreeable breakfast in the long,
low-walled breakfast-room, which opens upon the flower garden, we
went to Windsor to worship in St. George&rsquo;s Chapel.&nbsp;
The Queen&rsquo;s stall is rather larger than the others, and one
is left vacant for the Prince of Wales.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
July 29th.</p>
<p>And now with a new sheet I must begin my account of Nuneham. .
. . The Archbishop of York is the second son of Lord Vernon, but
his uncle, Earl Harcourt, dying without children, left him all
his estate, upon which he took the name of Harcourt.&nbsp; We
arrived about four o&rsquo;clock. . . . The dinner was at
half-past seven, and when I went down I found the Duchess of
Sutherland, Lady Caroline Leveson-Gower, Lord Kildare, and
several of the sons and daughters of the Archbishop.&nbsp; The
dinner and evening passed off very agreeably.&nbsp; The Duchess
is a most high-bred person, and thoroughly courteous.&nbsp; As we
were going in or out of a room instead of preceding me, which was
her right, she always made me take her arm, which was a delicate
way of getting over her precedence. . . . At half-past nine the
[next morning] we met in the drawing-room, when the Archbishop
led the way down to prayers.&nbsp; This was a beautiful scene,
for he is now ninety, and to hear him read the prayers with a
firm, clear voice, while his family and dependents knelt about
him was a pleasure never to be forgotten. . . . At five I was to
drive round the park with the Archbishop himself in his open
carriage.&nbsp; This drive was most charming.&nbsp; He explained
everything, told me when such trees would be felled, and when
certain tracts of underwood would be fit for cutting, how old the
different-sized deer were&mdash;in short, the whole economy of an
English park.&nbsp; Every pretty point of view, too, he made me
see, and was as active and wide-awake as if he were thirty,
rather than ninety. . . . The next morning, after prayers and
breakfast, I took my leave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Ann</span>: How I wish I could
transport you to the spot where I am writing, but if I could
summon it before your actual vision you would take it for a dream
or a romance, so different is everything within the walls which
enclose the precincts of an English Cathedral from anything we
can conceive on our side of the water. . . . Some of the learned
people and noblemen have formed an Arch&aelig;ological Society
for the study and preservation [of] the interesting architectural
antiquities of the kingdom, and [it] is upon the occasion of the
annual meeting of this society for a week at Norwich that the
Bishop has invited us to stay a few days at the palace and join
them in their agreeable antiquarian excursions.&nbsp; We arrived
on Friday at five o&rsquo;clock after a long dull journey of five
hours on the railway. . . . Staying in the house are our friends,
Mr. and Mrs. Milman, Lord Northampton and his son, Lord Alwyne
Compton, and the Bishop&rsquo;s family, consisting of Mrs.
Stanley, and of two Miss Stanleys, agreeable and highly
cultivated girls, and Mr. Arthur Stanley, the writer of Dr.
Arnold&rsquo;s Biography.</p>

</a></p>
<p>After dinner company soon arrived.&nbsp; Among them were Mrs.
Opie, who resides here.&nbsp; She is a pleasing, lively old lady,
in full Quaker dress.&nbsp; The most curious feature of the
evening was a visit which the company paid to the cellar and
kitchen, which were lighted up for the occasion.&nbsp; They were
build by the old Norman bishops of the twelfth century, and had
vaulted stone roofs as beautifully carved and ribbed as a
church.</p>
<p>The next day, Saturday, the antiquarians made a long excursion
to hunt up some ruins, while the Milmans, Mr. Stanley, and
ourselves, went to visit the place of Lady Suffield, about twelve
miles distant, and which is the most perfect specimen of the
Elizabethan style.&nbsp; Lady Suffield herself is as Elizabethan
as her establishment; she is of one [of] the oldest high Tory
families and so opposed to innovations of all sorts that though
her letters, which used to arrive at two, before the opening of
the railway two years ago, now arrive at seven in the morning,
they are never allowed to be brought till the old hour. . . .
This morning Mr. Bancroft and the rest are gone on an excursion
to Yarmouth to see some ruins, while I remain here to witness the
chairing of two new members of Parliament, who have just been
elected, of whom Lord Douro, son of the Duke of Wellington, is
one.</p>
<h3><i>To I. P. D.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Audley
End</span>, October 14, 1847.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Uncle</span>: We are staying for a
few days at Lord Braybrooke&rsquo;s place, one of the most
magnificent in England; but before I say a word about it I must
tell you of A.&rsquo;s safe arrival and how happy I have been
made by having him with me again. . . . On Saturday the 9th we
had the honor of dining with the <i>Lord Mayor</i> to meet the
Duke of Cambridge, a <i>f&ecirc;te</i> so unlike anything else
and accompanied by so many old and peculiar customs that I must
describe it to you at full length.&nbsp; The Mansion House is in
the heart of the <i>City</i>, and is very magnificent and
spacious, the Egyptian Hall, as the dining-room is called, being
one of the noblest apartments I have seen.&nbsp; The guests were
about 250 in number and were received by the Lady Mayoress
<i>sitting</i>.&nbsp; When dinner was announced, the Lord Mayor
went out first, preceded by the sword-bearer and mace-bearer and
all the insignia of office.&nbsp; Then came the Duke of Cambridge
and the Lady Mayoress, then Mr. Bancroft and I together, which is
the custom at these great civic feasts.&nbsp; We marched through
the long gallery by the music of the band to the Egyptian Hall,
where two raised seats like thrones were provided for the Lord
Mayor and Mayoress at the head of the hall.&nbsp; On the right
hand of the Lord Mayor sat the Duke of Cambridge in a <i>common
chair</i>, for royalty yields entirely to the Mayor, on his own
ground.&nbsp; On the right of the Duke of Cambridge sat the
Mayoress-elect (for the present dignitaries go out of office on
the 1st of November).&nbsp; On the left hand of the present Lady
Mayoress sat the Lord Mayor-<i>elect</i>, then I came with my
husband on my left hand in very conjugal style.</p>
<p>There were three tables the whole length of the hall, and that
at which we were placed went across at the head.&nbsp; When we
are placed, the herald stands behind the Lord Mayor and cries:
&ldquo;My Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen, pray silence, for
grace.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the chaplain in his gown, goes behind
the Lord Mayor and says grace.&nbsp; After the second course two
large gold cups, nearly two feet high, are placed before the
Mayor and Mayoress.&nbsp; The herald then cries with a loud
voice: &ldquo;His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, the
American Minister, the Lord Chief Baron,&rdquo; etc., etc.
(enumerating about a dozen of the most distinguished guests),
&ldquo;and ladies and gentlemen all, the Lord Mayor and Lady
Mayoress do bid you most heartily welcome and invite you to drink
in a loving cup.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon the Mayor and Mayoress
rise and each turn to their next neighbor, who take off the cover
while they drink.&nbsp; After my right-hand neighbor, the Lord
Mayor-elect, had put on the cover, he turns to me and says,
&ldquo;Please take off the cover,&rdquo; which I do and hold it
while he drinks; then I replace the cover and turn round to Mr.
Bancroft, who rises and performs the same office for me while I
drink; then he turns to his next neighbor, who takes off the
cover for him.&nbsp; I have not felt so solemn since I stood up
to be married as when Mr. Bancroft and I were standing up alone
together, the rest of the company looking on, I with this great
heavy gold cup in my hand, so heavy that I could scarcely lift it
to my mouth with both hands, and he with the cover before me,
with rather a mischievous expression in his face.&nbsp; Then came
two immense gold platters filled with rose water, which were also
passed round.&nbsp; These gold vessels were only used by the
persons at the head table; the other guests were served with
silver cups.&nbsp; When the dessert and the wine are placed on
the table, the herald says, &ldquo;My Lords, Ladies, and
Gentlemen, please to charge your glasses.&rdquo;&nbsp; After we
duly charge our glasses the herald cries: &ldquo;Lords, Ladies,
and Gentlemen, pray silence for the Lord Mayor.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
then rises and proposes the first toast, which is, of course,
always &ldquo;The Queen.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a time came the
&ldquo;American Minister,&rdquo; who was obliged to rise up at my
elbow and respond.&nbsp; We got home just after twelve.</p>

</a></p>
<p>And now let me try to give you some faint idea of Audley End,
which is by far the most magnificent house I have seen yet.&nbsp;
It was built by the Earl of Suffolk, son of the Duke of Norfolk
who was beheaded in Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign for high treason,
upon the site of an abbey, the lands of which had been granted by
the crown to that powerful family.&nbsp; One of the Earls of
Suffolk dying without sons, the <i>Earldom</i> passed into
another branch and the <i>Barony</i> and <i>estate</i> of Howard
de Walden came into the female line.&nbsp; In course of time, a
Lord Howard de Walden dying without a son, his title also passed
into another family, but his estate went to his nephew, Lord
Braybrooke, the father of the present Lord.&nbsp; Lady Braybrooke
is the daughter of the Marquis of Cornwallis, and granddaughter
of our American Lord Cornwallis.</p>
<p>The house is of the Elizabethan period and is one of the best
preserved specimens of that style, but of its vast extent and
magnificence I can give you no idea.&nbsp; We arrived about five
o&rsquo;clock, and were ushered through an immense hall of carved
oak hung with banners up a fine staircase to the grand saloon,
where we were received by the host and hostess.&nbsp; Now of this
grand saloon I must try to give you a conception.&nbsp; It was, I
should think, from seventy-five to one hundred feet in
length.&nbsp; The ceiling overhead was very rich with hanging
corbels, like stalactites, and the entire walls were panelled,
with a full-length family portrait in each panel, which was
arched at the top, so that the whole wall was composed of these
round-topped pictures with rich gilding between.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding its vast size, the sofas and tables were so
disposed all over the apartment as to give it the most friendly,
warm, and social aspect.</p>
<p>Lady Braybrooke herself ushered me to my apartments, which
were the state rooms.&nbsp; First came Mr. Bancroft&rsquo;s
dressing-room, where was a blazing fire.&nbsp; Then came the
bedroom, with the state bed of blue and gold, covered with
embroidery, and with the arms and coronet of Howard de
Walden.&nbsp; The walls were hung with crimson and white damask,
and the sofas and chairs also, and it was surrounded by pictures,
among others a full length of Queen Charlotte, just opposite the
foot of the bed, always saluted me every morning when I awoke,
with her fan, her hoop, and her deep ruffles.</p>
<p>My dressing-room, which was on the opposite side from Mr.
Bancroft&rsquo;s, was a perfect gem.&nbsp; It was painted by the
famous Rebecco who came over from Italy to ornament so many of
the great English houses at one time.&nbsp; The whole ceiling and
walls were covered with beautiful designs and with gilding, and a
beautiful recess for a couch was supported by fluted gilded
columns; the architraves and mouldings of the doors were gilt,
and the panels of the doors were filled with Rebecco&rsquo;s
beautiful designs.&nbsp; The chairs were of light blue
embroidered with thick, heavy gold, and all this bearing the
stamp of antiquity was a thousand times more interesting than
mere modern splendor.&nbsp; In the centre of the room was a
toilet of white muslin (universal here), and on it a gilt
dressing-glass, which gave pretty effect to the whole.</p>
<p>I sat at dinner between Lord Braybrooke and Sir John Boileau,
and found them both very agreeable.&nbsp; The dining-room is as
magnificent as the other apartments.&nbsp; The ceiling is in the
Elizabethan style, covered with figures, and the walls white and
gold panelling hung with full-length family portraits not set
into the wall like the saloon, but in frames.&nbsp; In the
evening the young people had a round game at cards and the elder
ones seemed to prefer talking to a game at whist.&nbsp; The
ladies brought down their embroidery or netting.&nbsp; At eleven
a tray with wine and water is brought in and a quantity of bed
candlesticks, and everybody retires when they like.&nbsp; The
next morning the guests assembled at half-past nine in the great
gallery which leads to the chapel to go in together to
prayers.&nbsp; The chapel is really a beautiful little piece of
architecture, with a vaulted roof and windows of painted
glass.&nbsp; On one side is the original cast of the large
monument to Lord Cornwallis (our lord) which is in Westminster
Abbey.&nbsp; After breakfast we passed a couple of hours in going
all over the house, which is in perfect keeping in every
part.</p>
<p>We returned to the library, a room as splendid as the saloon,
only instead of pictured panels it was surrounded by books in
beautiful gilt bindings.&nbsp; In the immense bay window was a
large Louis Quatorze table, round which the ladies all placed
themselves at their embroidery, though I preferred looking over
curious illuminated missals, etc., etc.</p>
<p>The next day was the meeting of the County Agricultural
Society. . . . At the hour appointed we all repaired to the
ground where the prizes were to be given out. . . . Lord
Braybrooke made first a most paternal and interesting address,
which showed me in the most favorable view the relation between
the noble and the lower class in England, a relation which must
depend much on the personal character of the lord of the manor. .
. . First came prizes to ploughmen, then the plough boys, then
the shepherds, then to such peasants as had reared many children
without aid, then to women who had been many years in the same
farmer&rsquo;s service, etc., etc.&nbsp; A clock was awarded to a
poor man and his wife who had reared six children and buried
seven without aid from the parish.&nbsp; The rapture with which
Mr. and Mrs. Flitton and the whole six children gazed on this
clock, an immense treasure for a peasant&rsquo;s cottage, was
both comic and affecting. . . . The next morning we made our
adieus to our kind host and hostess, and set off for London,
accompanied by Sir John Tyrrell, Major Beresford, and young Mr.
Boileau.</p>
<h3><i>To W. D. B.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
November 4, 1847.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear</span> W.: . . . Mr. Bancroft and I
dined on Friday, the 22d, with Mr. and Mrs. Hawes,
under-Secretary of State, to meet Mr. Brooke, the Rajah of
Sarawak, who is a great lion in London just now.&nbsp; He is an
English gentleman of large fortune who has done much to
Christianize Borneo, and to open its trade to the English.&nbsp;
I sat between him and Mr. Ward, formerly Minister to Mexico
before Mr. Pakenham.&nbsp; He wrote a very nice book on Mexico,
and is an agreeable and intelligent person. . . . On Wednesday A.
and I went together to the National Gallery, and just as we were
setting out Mr. Butler of New York came in and I invited him to
join us. . . . While we were seated before a charming Claude who
should come in but Mr. R. W. Emerson and we had quite a joyful
greeting.&nbsp; Just then came in Mr. Rogers with two ladies, one
on each arm.&nbsp; He renewed his request that I would bring my
son to breakfast with him, and appointed Friday morning, and then
added if those gentlemen who are with you are your friends and
countrymen, perhaps they will accompany you.&nbsp; They very
gladly acceded, and I was thankful Mr. Emerson had chanced to be
with me at that moment as it procured him a high pleasure.</p>
<p>Yesterday your father and I dined with Sir George Grey. . . .
About four o&rsquo;clock came on such a fog as I have not seen in
London, and the newspapers of this morning speak of it as greater
than has been known for many years.&nbsp; Sir George Grey lives
in Eaton Place, which is parallel and just behind Eaton
Square.&nbsp; In going that little distance, though there is a
brilliant gas light at every door, the coachman was completely
bewildered, and lost himself entirely.&nbsp; We could only walk
the horses, the footman exploring ahead.&nbsp; When the guests by
degrees arrived, there was the same rejoicing as if we had met on
Mont St. Bernard after a contest with an Alpine snow-storm. . . .
Lady Grey told me she was dining with the Queen once in one of
these tremendous fogs, and that many of the guests did not arrive
till dinner was half through, which was horrible at a royal
dinner; but the elements care little for royalty.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">November 14th.</p>
<p>On Saturday we dined at the Duc de Broglie&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He
married the daughter of Madam de Sta&euml;l, but she is not now
living.&nbsp; I was very agreeably placed with Mr. Macaulay on
one side of me, so that I found it more pleasant than diplomatic
dinners usually.&nbsp; At the English tables we meet people who
know each other well, and have a common culture and tastes and
habits of familiarity, and a fund of pleasant stories, but of
course, at foreign tables, they neither know each other or the
English so well as to give the same easy flow to
conversation.&nbsp; I am afraid we are the greatest diners-out in
London, but we are brought into contact a great deal with the
literary and Parliamentary people, which our colleagues know
little about, as also with the clergy and the judges.&nbsp; I
should not be willing to make it the habit of my life, but it is
time not misspent during the years of our abode here. . . . The
good old Archbishop of York is dead, and I am glad I paid my
visit to him when I did.&nbsp; Mr. Rogers has paid me a long
visit to-day and gave me all the particulars of his death.&nbsp;
It was a subject I should not have introduced, for of that knot
of intimate friends, Mr. Grenville, the Archbishop, and himself,
he is now all that remains.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">November 28th.</p>
<p>. . . On Monday evening I went without Mr. Bancroft to a
little party at Mrs. Lyell&rsquo;s, where I was introduced to
Mrs. Somerville.&nbsp; She has resided for the last nine years
abroad, chiefly at Venice, but has now come to London and taken a
house very near us. . . . Her daughter told me that nothing could
exceed the ease and simplicity with which her literary
occupations were carried on.&nbsp; She is just publishing a book
upon Natural Geography without regard to political
boundaries.&nbsp; She writes principally before she rises in the
morning on a little piece of board, with her inkstand on a table
by her side.&nbsp; After she leaves her room she is as much at
leisure as other people, but if an idea strikes her she takes her
little board into a corner or window and writes quietly for a
short time and returns to join the circle.</p>
<p>Dr. Somerville told me that his wife did not discover her
genius for mathematics till she was about sixteen.&nbsp; Her
brother, who has no talent for it, was receiving a mathematical
lesson from a master while she was hemming and stitching in the
room.&nbsp; In this way she first heard the problems of Euclid
stated and was ravished.&nbsp; When the lesson was over, she
carried off the book to her room and devoured it.&nbsp; For a
long time she pursued her studies secretly, as she had scaled
heights of science which were not considered feminine by those
about her.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">December 2d.</p>
<p>I put down my pen yesterday when the carriage came to the door
for my drive.&nbsp; It was a day bright, beaming, and
exhilarating as one of our own winter days.&nbsp; I was so busy
enjoying the unusual beams of the unclouded sun that I did not
perceive for some time that I had left my muff, and was obliged
to drive home again to get it.&nbsp; While I was waiting in the
carriage for the footman to get it, two of the most agreeable
old-lady faces in the world presented themselves at the
window.&nbsp; They were the Miss Berrys.&nbsp; They had driven up
behind me and got out to have a little talk on the
sidewalk.&nbsp; I took them into Mr. Bancroft&rsquo;s room and
was thankful that my muff had sent me back to receive a visit
which at their age is rarely paid. . . . I found them full of
delight at Mr. Brooke, the Rajah of Sarawak, with whose nobleness
of soul they would have great sympathy.&nbsp; He is just now the
lion of London, and like all other lions is run after by most
people because he is one, and by the few because he deserves to
be one.&nbsp; Now, lest you should know nothing about him, let me
tell you that at his own expense he fitted out a vessel, and
established himself at Borneo, where he soon acquired so great
[an] ascendancy over the native Rajah, that he insisted on
resigning to him the government of his province of Sarawak.&nbsp;
Here, with only three European companions, by moral and
intellectual force alone, he succeeded in suppressing piracy and
civil war among the natives and opened a trade with the interior
of Borneo which promises great advantages to England. . . .
Everybody here has the <i>Influenza</i>&mdash;a right-down
influenza, that sends people to their beds.&nbsp; Those who have
triumphed at their exemption in the evening, wake up perhaps in
the morning full of aches in every limb, and scoff no longer. . .
. Dinner parties are sometimes quite broken up by the excuses
that come pouring in at the last moment.&nbsp; Lady John Russell
had seven last week at a small dinner of twelve; 1,200 policemen
at one time were taken off duty, so that the thieves might have
had their own way, but they were probably as badly off
themselves.</p>
<h3><i>To Mr. and Mrs. I. P. D.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
December 16, 1847.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Uncle and Aunt</span>: . . . On
Saturday Mr. Hallam wrote us that Sir Robert Peel had promised to
breakfast with him on Monday morning and he thought we should
like to meet him in that quiet way.&nbsp; So we presented
ourselves at ten o&rsquo;clock, and were joined by Sir Robert,
Lord Mahon, Macaulay, and Milman, who with Hallam himself, formed
a circle that could not be exceeded in the wide world.&nbsp; I
was the only lady, except Miss Hallam; but I am especially
favored in the breakfast line.&nbsp; I would cross the Atlantic
only for the pleasure I had that morning in hearing such men talk
for two or three hours in an entirely easy unceremonious
breakfast way.&nbsp; Sir Robert was full of stories, and showed
himself as much the scholar as the statesman.&nbsp; Macaulay was
overflowing as usual, and Lord Mahon and Milman are full of
learning and accomplishments.&nbsp; The classical scholarship of
these men is very perfect and sometimes one catches a glimpse of
awfully deep abysses of learning.&nbsp; But then it is
<i>only</i> a glimpse, for their learning has no cumbrous and
dull pedantry about it.&nbsp; They are all men of society and men
of the world, who keep up with it everywhere.&nbsp; There is many
a pleasant story and many a good joke, and everything discussed
but politics, which, as Sir Robert and Macaulay belong to
opposite dynasties, might be dangerous ground.</p>
<p>After dinner we went a little before ten to Lady Charlotte
Lindsay&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She came last week to say that she was to
have a little dinner on Monday and wished us to come in
afterwards.&nbsp; This is universal here, and is the easiest and
most agreeable form of society.&nbsp; She had Lord Brougham and
Colonel and Mrs. Dawson-Damer, etc., to dine. . . . Mrs. Damer
wished us to come the next evening to her in the same way, just
to get our cup of tea.&nbsp; These nice little teas are what you
need in Boston.&nbsp; There is no supper, no expense, nothing but
society.&nbsp; Mrs. Damer is the granddaughter of the beautiful
Lady Waldegrave, the niece of Horace Walpole, who married the
Duke of Gloucester.&nbsp; She was left an orphan at a year old
and was confided by her mother to the care of Mrs.
Fitzherbert.&nbsp; She lived with her until her marriage and was
a great pet of George IV, and tells a great many interesting
stories of him and Mrs. Fitzherbert, who was five years older
than he.</p>

<h3><i>To W. D. B.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
December 30, 1847.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear</span> W.: Your father left me on the
18th to go to Paris.&nbsp; This is the best of all seasons for
him to be there, for the Ministers are all out of town at
Christmas, and in Paris everything is at its height.&nbsp; My
friends are very kind to me&mdash;those who remain in town. . . .
One day I dined at Sir Francis Simpkinson&rsquo;s and found a
pleasant party.&nbsp; Lady Simpkinson is a sister of Lady
Franklin, whom I was very glad to meet, as she has been in
America and knows many Americans, Mrs. Kirkland for one. . . .
Then I have passed one evening for the first time at Mr.
Tagent&rsquo;s, the Unitarian clergyman, where I met many of the
literary people who are out of the great world, and yet very
desirable to see.</p>
<p>There, too, I met the Misses Cushman, Charlotte and Susan, who
attend his church.&nbsp; I was very much pleased with both of
them.&nbsp; I have never seen them play, but they will send me a
list of their parts at their next engagement and I shall
certainly go to hear them.&nbsp; They are of Old Colony descent
(from Elder Cushman), and have very much of the New England
character, culture, and good sense.&nbsp; On Monday I dined at
Sir Edward Codrington&rsquo;s, the hero of Navarino, with the
Marquis and Marchioness of Queensberry, and a party of admirals
and navy officers.&nbsp; On Tuesday I dined at Lady
Braye&rsquo;s, where were Mr. Rogers, Dr. Holland, Sir Augustus
and Lady Albinia Foster, formerly British Minister to the United
States.&nbsp; He could describe <i>our Court</i>, as he called
it, in the time of Madison and Monroe.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">January 1, 1848.</p>
<p>This evening, in addition to my usual morning letter from your
father, I have another; a new postal arrangement beginning to-day
with the New Year.&nbsp; He gives me a most interesting
conversation he has just been having with Baron von Humboldt, who
is now in Paris.&nbsp; He says he poured out a delicious stream
of remarks, anecdotes, narratives, opinion.&nbsp; He feels great
interest in our Mexican affairs, as he has been much there, and
is a Mexican by adoption.</p>
<p>His letter, dated the 31st December, says: &ldquo;Madam
Adelaide died at three this morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; This death
astonished me, for he saw her only a few evenings since at the
Palace.&nbsp; She was a woman of strong intellect and character,
and her brother, the King, was very much attached to her as a
counsellor and friend. . . . There were more than 100 Americans
to be presented on New Year&rsquo;s Day at Paris, and, as Madam
Adelaide&rsquo;s death took place without a day&rsquo;s warning,
you can imagine the embroidered coats and finery which were laid
on the shelf.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Saturday, January 7th.</p>
<p>Yesterday, my dear son, I had a delightful dinner at the dear
Miss Berrys.&nbsp; They drove to the door on Thursday and left a
little note to say, &ldquo;Can you forgive a poor sick soul for
not coming to you before, when you were all alone,&rdquo; and
begging me to come the next day at seven, to dine.&nbsp; There
was Lady Charlotte and Lady Stuart de Rothesay, who was many
years ambassadress at Paris, and very agreeable.&nbsp; Then there
was Dr. Holland and Mr. Stanley, the under-Secretary of State,
etc.&nbsp; In the evening came quite an additional party, and I
passed it most pleasantly. . . . Your father writes that on
Friday he dined at Thiers&rsquo; with Mignet, Cousin, Pontois,
and Lord Normanby.&nbsp; He says such a dinner is &ldquo;unique
in a man&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mignet is delightful,
frank, open, gay, full of intelligence, and of that grace which
makes society charming.&rdquo; . . . Your father to-day gives me
some account of Thiers.&nbsp; He is now fifty: he rises at five
o&rsquo;clock every morning, toils till twelve, breakfasts, makes
researches, and then goes to the Chambers.&nbsp; In the evening
he always receives his friends except Wednesdays and Thursdays,
when he attends his wife to the opera and to the
Acad&eacute;mie.</p>
<h3><i>To Mr. and Mrs. I. P. D.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
January 28th, 1848.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Uncle and Aunt</span>: . . . Last
Monday I received [this] note from George Sumner, which I thought
might interest you: &ldquo;My dear Mrs. Bancroft: I hasten to
congratulate you upon an event most honorable to Mr. Bancroft and
to our country.&nbsp; The highest honor which can be bestowed in
France upon a foreigner has just been conferred on him.&nbsp; He
was chosen this afternoon a Corresponding Member of the
Institute.&nbsp; Five names were presented for the vacant chair
of History.&nbsp; Every vote but one was in favor of Mr. Bancroft
(that one for Mr. Grote of London, author of the &lsquo;History
of Greece&rsquo;).&nbsp; A gratifying fact in regard to this
election is that it comes without the knowledge of Mr. Bancroft,
and without any of those preliminary visits on his part, and
those appeals to academicians whose votes are desired, that are
so common with candidates for vacancies at the Institute.&nbsp;
The honor acquires double value for being unsought, and I have
heard with no small satisfaction several Members of the Academy
contrast the modest reserve of Mr. Bancroft with the restless
manoeuvres to which they have been accustomed.&nbsp; Prescott,
you know, is already a member, and I think America may be
satisfied with two out of seven of a class of History which is
selected from the world.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><i>To T. D.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
February 24, 1848.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>: . . . Great
excitement exists in London to-day at the reception of the news
from France.&nbsp; Guizot is overthrown, and Count Mol&eacute; is
made Prime Minister.&nbsp; The National Guards have sided with
the people, and would not fire upon them, and that secret of the
weakness of the army being revealed, I do not see why the Liberal
party cannot obtain all they want in the end.&nbsp; Louis
Philippe has sacrificed the happiness of France for the
advancement of his own family, but nations in the nineteenth
[century] have learned that they were not made to be the slaves
of a dynasty.&nbsp; Mr. Bancroft dines with the French Minister
to-day, not with a party, but quite <i>en famille</i>, and he
will learn there what the hopes and fears of the Government
are.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">February 25th.</p>
<p>The news this morning is only from Amiens, which has risen in
support of France.&nbsp; The railways are torn up all round
Paris, to prevent the passage of troops, and the roads and
barriers are all in possession of the people.&nbsp; All France
will follow the lead of Paris, and what will be the result Heaven
only knows.</p>
<h3><i>To I. P. D.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
February 26, 1848.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Uncle</span>: . . . On Thursday
Mr. Bancroft dined with Count Jarnac, the Minister in the Duc de
Broglie&rsquo;s absence, and he little dreamed of the blow
awaiting him.&nbsp; The fortifications and the army seemed to
make the King quite secure.&nbsp; On Friday Mr. Bancroft went to
dine with Kenyon, and I drove there with him for a little
air.&nbsp; On my return Cates, the butler, saluted me with the
wondrous news of the deposition and flight of the royal family,
which Mr. Brodhead had rushed up from his club to impart to
us.&nbsp; I was engaged to a little party at Mr. Hallam&rsquo;s,
where I found everybody in great excitement.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Sunday Noon.</p>
<p>To-day we were to have dined with Baron de Rothschild, but
this morning I got a note from the beautiful baroness, saying
that her sister-in-law and her mother with three children, had
just arrived from Paris at her house in the greatest distress,
without a change of clothes, and in deep anxiety about the Baron,
who had stayed behind.</p>
<p>Our colleagues all look bewildered and perplexed beyond
measure. . . . The English aristocracy have no love for Louis
Philippe, but much less for a republic, so near at hand, and
everybody seemed perplexed and uneasy.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Sunday the Duc de Nemours arrived at the French Embassy,
and Monday the poor Duchess de Montpensier, the innocent cause of
all the trouble.&nbsp; No one knows where the Duchess de Nemours
and her young children are, and the King and Queen are entirely
missing.&nbsp; At one moment it is reported that he is drowned,
and then, again, at Brussels.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Wednesday.</p>
<p>To-day the French Embassy have received despatches announcing
the new government, and Count Jarnac has immediately
resigned.&nbsp; This made it impossible for the Duc de Nemours
and the Duchess de Montpensier to remain at the Embassy, and they
fell by inheritance to Mr. Van de Weyer, whose Queen is Louis
Philippe&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; The Queen has taken Louis
Philippe&rsquo;s daughter, Princess Clementine, who married
Prince Auguste de Saxe-Coburg to the Palace, but for State
Policy&rsquo;s sake she can do nothing about the others.&nbsp;
Mr. Van de Weyer offered Mr. Bates&rsquo;s place of East Sheen,
which was most gratefully accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Friday.</p>
<p>This morning came Thackeray, who is the soul of <i>Punch</i>,
and showed me a piece he had written for the next number.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Saturday.</p>
<p>The King has arrived.&nbsp; What a crossing of the Channel,
pea-jacket, woollen comforter, and all!&nbsp; The flight is a
perfect comedy, and if <i>Punch</i> had tried to invent anything
more ludicrous, it would have failed.&nbsp; Panic, despotism, and
cowardice.</p>
<p>These things are much more exciting here than across the
water.&nbsp; We are so near the scene of action and everybody has
a more personal interest here in all these matters.&nbsp; The
whole week has been like a long play, and now, on Saturday night,
I want nothing but repose.&nbsp; What a dream it must be to the
chief actors!&nbsp; The Queen, who is always good and noble, was
averse to such ignominious flight; she preferred staying and
taking what came, and if Madam Adelaide had lived, they would
never have made such a [word undecipherable] figure.&nbsp; Her
pride and courage would have inspired them.&nbsp; With her seemed
to fly Louis Philippe&rsquo;s star, as Napoleon&rsquo;s with
Josephine. . . . Mr. Emerson has just come to London and we give
him a dinner on Tuesday, the 14th.&nbsp; Several persons wish
much to see him, and Monckton Milnes reviewed him in
<i>Blackwood</i>.</p>
<h3><i>To W. D. B.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
March 11, 1848.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear</span> W.: . . . Yesterday we dined
at Lord Lansdowne&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Among the guests were M. and
Madam Van de Weyer, and Mrs. Austin, the translatress, who has
been driven over here from Paris, where she has resided for
several years.&nbsp; She is a vehement friend of Guizot&rsquo;s,
though a bitter accuser of Louis Philippe, but how can they be
separated?&nbsp; She interests herself strongly now in all his
arrangements, and is assisting his daughters to form their humble
establishment.&nbsp; He and his daughters together have about
eight hundred pounds a year, and that in London is poverty.&nbsp;
They have taken a small house in Brompton Square, a little out of
town, and one of those suburban, unfashionable regions where the
most accommodations can be had at the least price.&nbsp; What a
change for those who have witnessed their almost regal receptions
in Paris!&nbsp; The young ladies bear very sweetly all their
reverses. . . . Guizot, himself, I hear, is as <i>fier</i> as
ever, and almost gay.&nbsp; Princess de Lieven is here at the
&ldquo;Clarendon,&rdquo; and their friendship is as great as
ever.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">March 15th.</p>
<p>Yesterday we had an agreeable dinner at our own house.&nbsp;
Macaulay, Milman, Lord Morpeth and Monckton Milnes were all most
charming, and we ladies listened with eager ears.&nbsp;
Conversation was never more interesting than just now, in this
great crisis of the world&rsquo;s affairs.&nbsp; Mr. Emerson was
here and seemed to enjoy [it] much.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Friday, March 17th.</p>
<p>Things look rather darker in France, but we ought not to
expect a republic to be established without some difficulties. .
. . You cannot judge of the state of France, however, through the
medium of the English newspapers, for, of course, English
sympathies are all entirely against it.&nbsp; They never like
France, and a republic of any kind still less.&nbsp; A peaceful
and prosperous republic in the heart of Europe would be more
deprecated than a state of anarchy.&nbsp; The discussion of
French matters reveals to me every moment the deep repugnance of
the English to republican institutions.&nbsp; It lets in a world
of light upon opinions and feelings, which, otherwise, would not
have been discovered by me.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">Sunday, March 19th.</p>
<p>Yesterday we breakfasted at Mrs. Milman&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I was
the only lady, but there were Macaulay, Hallam, Lord Morpeth,
and, above all, Charles Austin, whom I had not seen before, as he
never dines out, but who is the most striking talker in
England.&nbsp; He has made a fortune by the law in the last few
years, which gives him an income of &pound;8,000.&nbsp; He has
the great railroad cases which come before the House of Lords. .
. . On Tuesday came a flying report of a revolution in Berlin,
but no one believed it.&nbsp; We concluded it rather a
speculation of the newsmen, who are hawking revolutions after
every mail in second and third editions.&nbsp; We were going that
evening to a <i>soir&eacute;e</i> at Bunsen&rsquo;s, whom we
found cheerful as ever and fearing no evil.&nbsp; On Monday the
news of the revolution in Austria produced a greater sensation
even than France, for it was the very pivot of conservatism. . .
. On Thursday I received the letter from A. at eight <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>, which I enclose to you.&nbsp; It
gives an account of the revolution in Berlin.</p>
<h3><i>To T. D.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right">March 31.</p>
<p>The old world is undergoing a complete reorganization, and is
unfolding a rapid series of events more astonishing than anything
in history.&nbsp; Where it will stop, and what will be its
results, nobody can tell.&nbsp; Royalty has certainly not added
to its respectability by its conduct in its time of trial.&nbsp;
Since the last steamer went, Italy has shaken off the Austrian
yoke, Denmark has lost her German provinces, Poland has risen, or
is about to rise, which will bring Russia thundering down upon
Liberal Europe. . . . Our whole Diplomatic Corps are certainly
&ldquo;in a fix,&rdquo; and we are really the only members of it
who have any reason to be quite at ease.&nbsp; Two or three have
been called home to be Ministers of Foreign Affairs, as they have
learned something of constitutional liberty in England.&nbsp;
England is, as yet, all quiet, and I hope will keep so, but the
Chartists are at work and Ireland is full of inflammable
matter.&nbsp; But England does love her institutions, and is
justly proud of their comparative freedom, and long may she enjoy
them. . . . On Sunday Mr. Emerson dined with us with Lady Morgan
and Mrs. Jameson&mdash;the authoress.&nbsp; On Monday I took him
to a little party at Lady Morgan&rsquo;s.&nbsp; His works are a
good deal known here.&nbsp; I have great pleasure in seeing so
old a friend so far from home. . . . I think we shall have very
few of our countrymen out this spring, as travelling Europe is so
uncertain, with everything in commotion.&nbsp; Those who are
passing the winter in Italy are quite shut in at present, and if
war begins, no one knows where it will spread.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,

<p>. . . On Wednesday we had an agreeable dinner at Mrs. Milner
Gibson&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Disraeli, Mr. and Mrs.
Sheridan (brother of Mrs. Norton), etc., were among the
guests.&nbsp; After dinner I had a very long talk with
Disraeli.&nbsp; He is, you know, of the ultra Tory party here,
and looks at the Continental movements from the darkest point of
view.&nbsp; He cannot admit as a possibility the renovation of
European society upon more liberal principles, and considers it
as the complete dissolution of European civilization which will,
like Asia, soon present but the ashes of a burnt-out flame.&nbsp;
This is most atheistic, godless, and un-christian doctrine, and
he cannot himself believe it.&nbsp; The art of printing and the
rapid dissemination of thought changes all these things in our
days.</p>
<h3><i>To I. P. D.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right">April 10.</p>
<p>This is the day of the &ldquo;Great Chartist Meeting,&rdquo;
which has terrified all London to the last degree, I think most
needlessly.&nbsp; The city and town is at this moment stiller
than I have ever known it, for not a carriage dares to be
out.&nbsp; Nothing is to be seen but a &ldquo;special
constable&rdquo; (every gentleman in London is sworn into that
office), occasionally some on foot, some on horseback, scouring
the streets.&nbsp; I took a drive early this morning with Mr.
Bancroft, and nothing could be less like the eve of a
revolution.&nbsp; This evening, when the petition is to be
presented, may bring some disturbance, not from the Chartists
themselves, but from the disorderly persons who may avail
themselves of the occasion.&nbsp; The Queen left town on Saturday
for the Isle of Wight, as she had so lately been confined it was
feared her health might suffer from any agitation. . . . I passed
a long train of artillery on Saturday evening coming into town,
which was the most earnest looking thing I have seen. . . .
To-day we were to have dined at Mrs. Mansfield&rsquo;s, but her
dinner was postponed from the great alarm about the
Chartists.&nbsp; There is not the slightest danger of a
revolution in England.&nbsp; The upper middle-class, which on the
continent is entirely with the people, the professional and
mercantile class, is here entirely conservative, and without that
class no great changes can ever be made.&nbsp; The Duc de
Montebello said of France, that he &ldquo;knew there were lava
streams below, but he did not know the crust was so
thin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, on the contrary, the crust is very
thick.&nbsp; And yet I can see in the most conservative circles
that a feeling is gaining ground that some concessions must be
made.&nbsp; An enlargement of the suffrage one hears now often
discussed as, perhaps, an approaching necessity.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Friday, April 14.</p>
<p>The day of the Chartists passed off with most ridiculous
quiet, and the government is stronger than ever. . . . If the
Alien Bill passes, our American friends must mind their p&rsquo;s
and q&rsquo;s, for if they praise the &ldquo;model
republic&rdquo; too loudly, they may be packed off at any time,
particularly if they have &ldquo;long beards,&rdquo; for it seems
to be an axiom here that beards, mustaches, and barricades are
cousins-german at least. . . . Mr. Bancroft goes to Paris on

<h3><i>To W. D. B.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
April 19, 1848.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear</span> W.: . . . To-day I have driven
down to Richmond to lunch with Mrs. Drummond, who is passing
Easter holidays there.&nbsp; On coming home I found a letter from
Mr. Bancroft from which I will make some extracts, as he has the
best sources of knowledge in Paris.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I went to
Mignet, who, you know, is politically the friend of Thiers.&nbsp;
He pointed out to me the condition of France, and drew for me a
picture of what it was and of the change.&nbsp; I begin to see
the difference between France and us.&nbsp; Here they are
accustomed to <i>be</i> governed.&nbsp; <i>We</i> are accustomed
to <i>govern</i>.&nbsp; <i>Here</i> power may be seized and
exercised, if exercised in a satisfactory manner; with us the
foundation of power, its constitutionality and the legality of
its acts are canvassed and analyzed.&nbsp; Here an unpopularity
is made away with by a revolution, and you know how <i>we</i>
deal with it.&nbsp; Thus, power, if in favor, may dare anything,
and if out of favor is little likely to be forgiven.&rdquo; . . .
&ldquo;Our fathers had to unite the thirteen States; here they
have unity enough and run no risk but from the excess of
it.&nbsp; My hopes are not less than they were, but all that
France needs may not come at once.&nbsp; We were fourteen years
in changing our confederation into a union, perhaps France cannot
be expected to jump at once into perfect legislation or perfect
forms.&nbsp; Crude ideas are afloat, but as to Communism, it is
already exploded, or will be brushed away from legislative power
as soon as the National Assembly meets, though the question of
ameliorating the condition of the laboring class is more and more
engaging the public mind.&rdquo; . . . &ldquo;I spent an hour
with Cousin, the Minister of a morning.&nbsp; He gave me sketches
of many of the leading men of these times, and I made him detail
to me he scene of Louis Philippe&rsquo;s abdication, which took
place in a manner quite different from what I had heard in
London.&rdquo; . . . &ldquo;Cousin, by the way, says that the Duc
de Nemours throughout, behaved exceedingly well.&nbsp; Thence to
the Club de la Nouvelle Republique.&nbsp; Did not think much of
the speaking which I heard.&nbsp; From the club I went to Thiers,
where I found Cousin and Mignet and one or two more.&nbsp; Some
change since I met him.&nbsp; A leader of opposition, then a
prime minister, and now left aground by the shifting tide.&rdquo;
. . . &ldquo;Everybody has given up Louis Philippe, everybody
considers the nonsense of Louis Blanc as drawing to its
close.&nbsp; The delegates from Paris will full half be
<i>universally</i> acceptable.&nbsp; Three-fourths of the
provincial delegates will be <i>moderate</i> republicans.&nbsp;
The people are not in a passion.&nbsp; They go quietly enough
about their business of constructing new institutions.&nbsp;
Ledru-Rollin, Louis Blanc, and Flocon tried to lead the way to
ill, but Lamartine, whose heroism passes belief and activity
passes human power, won the victory over them, found himself on
Sunday, and again yesterday, sustained by all Paris, and has not
only conquered but <i>conciliated</i> them, and everybody is now
firmly of opinion that the Republic will be established
quietly.&rdquo; . . . &ldquo;But while there are no difficulties
from the disorderly but what can easily be overcome, the want of
republican and political experience, combined with vanity and
self-reliance and idealism, may throw impediments in the way of
what the wisest wish, <i>viz.</i>, two elected chambers and a
president.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,

<p><span class="smcap">My dear</span> W.: . . . Last evening,
Thursday, we went to see Jenny Lind, on her first appearance this
year.&nbsp; She was received with enthusiasm, and the Queen still
more so.&nbsp; It was the first time the Queen had been at the
opera since the birth of her child, and since the republican
spirit was abroad, and loyalty burst out in full force.&nbsp; Now
loyalty is very novel, and pleasant to witness, to us who have
never known it.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
May 31, 1848.</p>
<p>. . . Now for my journal, which has gone lamely on since the
24th of February.&nbsp; The Queen&rsquo;s Ball was to take place
the evening on which I closed my last letter.&nbsp; My dress was
a white cr&ecirc;pe over white satin, with flounces of Honiton
lace looped up with pink tuberoses.&nbsp; A wreath of tuberoses
and bouquet for the corsage.&nbsp; We had tickets sent us to go
through the garden and set down at a private door, which saves
waiting in the long line of carriages for your turn.&nbsp; The
Diplomatic Corps arrange themselves in a line near the door at
which the Queen enters the suite of rooms, which was at ten
precisely.&nbsp; She passes through, curtseying and bowing very
gracefully, until she reaches the throne in the next room, where
she and the Duchess of Cambridge, the Duchess of Saxe-Weimar and
her daughters, who are here on a visit, etc., sit down, while
Prince Albert, the Prince of Prussia and other sprigs of royalty
stand near.&nbsp; The dancing soon began in front of the canopy,
but the Queen herself did not dance on account of her mourning
for Prince Albert&rsquo;s grandmother.&nbsp; There was another
band and dancing in other rooms at the same time.&nbsp; After
seeing several dances here the Queen and her suite move by the
flourish of trumpets to another room, the guests forming a lane
as she passes, bowing and smiling.&nbsp; Afterward she made a
similar progress to supper, her household officers moving
backwards before her, and her ladies and royal relatives and
friends following.&nbsp; At half-past one Her Majesty retired and
the guests departed, such as did not have to wait two hours for
their carriages.&nbsp; On Saturday we went at two to the
<i>f&ecirc;te</i> of flowers at Chiswick, and at half-past seven
dined at Lord Monteagle&rsquo;s to meet Monsieur and Mademoiselle
Guizot.&nbsp; He has the finest head in the world, but his person
is short and insignificant.</p>
<p>On Wednesday we dined at Lady Chantrey&rsquo;s to meet a
charming party.&nbsp; Afterward we went to a magnificent ball at
the Duke of Devonshire&rsquo;s, with all the great world.&nbsp;
On Friday we went to Faraday&rsquo;s lecture at the Royal
Institution.&nbsp; We went in with the Duke and Duchess of
Northumberland, and I sat by her during the lecture.&nbsp; On
Saturday was the Queen&rsquo;s Birthday Drawing-Room. . . . Mr.
Bancroft dined at Lord Palmerston&rsquo;s with all the diplomats,
and I went in the evening with a small party of ladies.&nbsp; On
coming home we drove round to see the brilliant birthday
illuminations.&nbsp; The first piece of intelligence I heard at
Lady Palmerston&rsquo;s was the death of the Princess Sophia, an
event which is a happy release for her, for she was blind and a
great sufferer.&nbsp; It has overturned all court festivities, of
course, for the present, and puts us all in deep mourning, which
is not very convenient just now, in the brilliant season, and
when we had all our dress arrangements made.&nbsp; The Queen was
to have a concert to-night, a drawing-room next Friday, and a
ball on the 16th, which are all deferred. . . . I forgot to say
that I got a note from Miss Coutts on Sunday, asking me to go
with her the next day to see the Chinese junk, so at three the
next day we repaired to her house.&nbsp; Her sisters (Miss
Burdetts) and Mr. Rogers were all the party.&nbsp; At the junk
for the first time I saw Metternich and the Princess, his
wife.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,

<p><span class="smcap">My dear</span> W.: . . . When I last left
off I was going to dine at Miss Coutts&rsquo;s to meet the
Duchess of Cambridge.&nbsp; The party was brilliant, including
the Duke of Wellington, Lord and Lady Douro, Lady Jersey and the
beautiful Lady Clementina Villiers, her daughter, etc.&nbsp; When
royal people arrive everybody rises and remains standing while
they stand, and if they approach you or look at you, you must
perform the lowest of &ldquo;curtsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; The courtesy
made to royalty is very like the one I was taught to make when a
little girl at Miss Tuft&rsquo;s school in Plymouth.&nbsp; One
sinks down instead of stepping back in dancing-school
fashion.&nbsp; After dinner the Duchess was pleased to stand
until the gentlemen rejoined us; of course, we must all stand. .
. . The next day we dined at the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s to meet the
Ministers.&nbsp; This was a most interesting affair.&nbsp; We had
all the peculiar ceremonies which I described to you last autumn,
but in addition the party was most distinguished, and we had
speeches from Lord Lansdowne, Lord Palmerston, Lord John, Lord
Auckland, Sir George Grey, etc.</p>

<p>I was truly grieved that the last steamer should go to Boston
without a line from me, but I was in Yorkshire and you must
forgive me. . . . I left off with the 26th of June. . . . The
next evening was the Queen&rsquo;s Concert, which was most
charming.&nbsp; I sat very near the Duke of Wellington, who often
spoke to me between the songs. . . . The next day we went with
Miss Coutts to her bank, lunched there, and went all over the
building.&nbsp; Then we went to the Tower and the Tunnel
together, she never having seen either.&nbsp; So ignorant are the
West End people of city lions. . . . And now comes my pleasant
Yorkshire excursion.&nbsp; We left London, at half-past three, at
distance of 180 miles.&nbsp; This was Saturday, July 8.&nbsp; At
York we found Mr. Hudson ready to receive us and conduct us to a
special train which took us eighteen miles on the way to Newby
Park, and there we found carriages to take us four miles to our
destination.&nbsp; We met at dinner and found our party to
consist of the Duke of Richmond, Lord Lonsdale, Lord George
Bentinck, Lord Ingestre, Lord John Beresford, Lady Webster, whose
husband, now dead, was the son of Lady Holland, two or three
agreeable talkers to fill in, and ourselves.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">Tuesday.</p>
<p>Lady Webster, Mr. Bancroft, and myself, went to Castle Howard,
as Lord Morpeth had written to his mother that we were to be
there and would lunch with her.&nbsp; Castle Howard is
twenty-five miles the other side of York, which is itself
twenty-five miles from Newby.&nbsp; But what is fifty miles when
one is under the wing of the Railway King and can have a special
engine at one&rsquo;s disposal.&nbsp; On arriving at the Castle
Howard station we found Lord Carlisle&rsquo;s carriage with four
horses and most venerable coachman waiting to receive us.&nbsp;
We enter the Park almost immediately, but it is about four miles
to the Castle, through many gates, which we had mounted footmen
open for us.&nbsp; Lady Carlisle received us in the most
delightful manner. . . . I was delighted to see Lord
Morpeth&rsquo;s home and his mother, who seldom now goes to
London.&nbsp; She was the daughter of the beautiful Duchess of
Devonshire, and took me into her own dressing-room to show me her
picture. . . . On Wednesday we went into York to witness the
reception of Prince Albert, to see the ruins of St. Mary&rsquo;s
Abbey, the Flower Show, to lunch with the Lord Mayor, and above
all, to attend prayers in the Minister and hear a noble
anthem.&nbsp; The Cathedral was crowded with strangers and a
great many from London.&nbsp; The next day was the day of the
great dinner, and I send you the <i>Post</i> containing Mr.
Bancroft&rsquo;s speech.&nbsp; It was warmly admired by all who
heard it.</p>
<p>At ten at night we ladies set out for York to go [to] the Lord
Mayor&rsquo;s Ball, where the gentlemen were to meet us from the
dinner.&nbsp; Everybody flocked round to congratulate me upon
your father&rsquo;s speech.&nbsp; Even Prince Albert, when I was
led up to make my curtsey, offered me his hand, which is a great
courtesy in royalty, and spoke of the great beauty and eloquence
of Mr. B.&rsquo;s speech.&nbsp; The Prince soon went away: the
Lord Mayor took me down to supper and I sat between him and the
Duke of Richmond at the high table which went across the head of
the hall.&nbsp; Guildhall is a beautiful old room with a fine old
traceried window, and the scene, with five tables going the
length of the hall and the upper one across the head, was very
gay and brilliant.&nbsp; There were a few toasts, and your father
again made a little speech, short and pleasant.&nbsp; We did not
get home till half-past three in the morning. . . . On Friday
morning [July 14th] many of the guests, the Duke of Richmond,
etc., took their departure and Mr. Hudson had to escort Prince
Albert to town, but returned the same evening. . . . The next day
we all went to pay a visit to an estate of Mr. Hudson&rsquo;s
[name of estate indecipherable] for which he paid five hundred
thousand pounds to the Duke of Devonshire. . . . It is nobly
situated in the Yorkshire wolds, a fine range of hills, and
overlooking the valley of the Humber, which was interesting to
me, as it was the river which our Pilgrim fathers sailed down and
lay in the Wash at its mouth, awaiting their passage to
Holland.&nbsp; They came, our Plymouth fathers, mostly from
Lincolnshire and the region which lay below us.&nbsp; I thought
of them, and the scene of their sufferings was more ennobled in
my eyes, from their remembrance than from the noble mansions and
rich estates which feast the eye.</p>

<p>On Monday morning we left Newby for York on our way
home.&nbsp; It so happened that the judges were to open the court
that very morning, on which occasion they always breakfast with
the Lord Mayor in their scarlet robes and wigs, the Lord Mayor
and aldermen are also in their furred scarlet robes and the Lady
Mayoress presents the judges with enormous bouquets of the
richest flowers.&nbsp; We were invited to this breakfast, and I
found it very entertaining.&nbsp; I was next the High Sheriff,
who was very desirous that we should stay a few hours and go to
the castle and see the court opened and listen to a case or
two.&nbsp; The High Sheriff of a county is a great character and
has a carriage and liveries as grand as the Queen&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
After breakfast we bade adieu to our York friends, and set off
with our big bouquets (for the distribution was extended to us)
for home.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>: . . . On Saturday
we set off for Nuneham, the magnificent seat of the late
Archbishop of York, now in possession of his eldest son, Mr.
Granville Harcourt. . . . The guests besides ourselves were Sir
Robert and Lady Peel, Lord and Lady Villiers, Lord and Lady
Norreys, Lord Harry Vane, etc.&nbsp; We considered it a great
privilege to be staying in the same house with Sir Robert Peel,
and I had also the pleasure of sitting by him at dinner all the
three days we were there.&nbsp; He was full of conversation of
the best kind.&nbsp; Mr. Denison and Lady Charlotte, his wife,
were also of our party.&nbsp; She was the daughter of the Duke of
Portland and sister of Lord George Bentinck, Sir Robert&rsquo;s
great antagonist in the House.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning we attended the pretty little church on the
estate which with its parsonage is a pleasing object on the
grounds.&nbsp; The next day the whole party were taken to
Blenheim, the seat of the famous Duke of Marlborough, built at
the expense of the country.&nbsp; The grounds are exquisite, but
I was most charmed by the collection of pictures.&nbsp; Here were
the finest Vandykes, Rubens, and Sir Joshua Reynolds which I have
seen.&nbsp; Sir Robert Peel is a great connoisseur in art and
seemed highly to enjoy them.&nbsp; Altogether it was a truly
delightful day: the drive of fifteen miles in open carriages, and
through Oxford, being of itself a high pleasure.&nbsp; Yesterday
we returned to London, and on Thursday we set out for
Scotland.</p>

class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, August 16, 1848.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Uncle and Aunt</span>: . . . Of
Edinburgh I cannot say enough to express my admiration.&nbsp; The
Castle Rock, Arthur&rsquo;s Seat, Salisbury Craigs and Calton
Hill are all separate and fine mountains and, with the Frith of
Forth, the ocean and the old picturesque town, make an assemblage
of fine objects that I have seen nowhere else.&nbsp; Mr.
Rutherford, the Lord Advocate, who is of the Ministry, had
written to his friends that we were coming, and several gentlemen
came by breakfast time the next morning.&nbsp; Mr. Gordon, his
nephew, married the daughter of Prof. Wilson, and invited us to
dine that day to meet the professor, etc. . . . We drove out
after breakfast into the country to Hawthornden, formerly the
residence of Drummond the poet, and to Lord Roslin&rsquo;s
grounds, where are the ruins of Roslin Castle and above all, of
the Roslin Chapel. . . . After lingering and admiring long we
returned to Edinburgh just in season for dinner at Mr.
Gordon&rsquo;s, where we found Prof. Wilson, and another daughter
and son, Mrs. Rutherford, wife of the Lord Advocate, and Capt.
Rutherford, his brother, with his wife.&nbsp; We had a very
agreeable evening and engaged to dine there again quite <i>en
famille</i>, with only the professor, whose conversation is
delightful.</p>

<p>The next morning we went out to Craigcrook, Lord
Jeffrey&rsquo;s country seat, to see and lunch with him.&nbsp; He
was confined to his couch. . . . He is seventy-three or
seventy-four, but looks not a minute older than fifty.&nbsp; He
has a fine head and forehead, and most agreeable and courteous
manners, rather of the old school.&nbsp; As he could not rise to
receive me he kissed my hand.&nbsp; Mrs. Jeffrey is an
intelligent and agreeable woman but has been much out of health
the last year.&nbsp; She was Miss Wilkes of New York, you
know.&nbsp; The house was an old castellated and fortified house,
and with modern additions is a most beautiful residence.&nbsp;
Capt. Rutherford told me that when he received the Lord
Advocate&rsquo;s letter announcing that we were coming, he went
to see Lord Jeffrey to know if he would be well enough to see us,
and he expressed the strongest admiration for Mr.
Bancroft&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>This may have disposed them to receive us with the cordiality
which made our visit so agreeable.&nbsp; Mr. Empson, his
son-in-law and the president editor of the Edinburgh Review, was
staying there, and after talking two hours with Lord and Mrs.
Jeffrey we took with him a walk in the grounds from which are
delightful and commanding views of the whole environs, and never
were environs so beautiful.</p>
<h3><i>To W. D. B.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Tarbet on Loch
Lomond</span>, August 28, 1848.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear</span> W. . . . Being detained here
by rain this morning I devote it to you and to my journal. . . .
The next day was Sunday but the weather being fine we concluded
to continue our journey, and followed the Tay seeing Birnam Wood
and Dunsinane on our way up to Dunkeld, near to which is the fine
seat of the Duke of Athol.&nbsp; We took a delightful walk in the
beautiful grounds, and went on to Blair Athol to sleep.&nbsp;
This is the chief residence of the Duke of Athol and he has here
another house and grounds very pretty though not as extensive as
those at Dunkeld. . . . When the innkeeper found who we were he
insisted on sending a message to the Duke who sent down an order
to us to drive up Glen Tilt and met us there himself.&nbsp; We
entered through the Park and followed up the Tilt.&nbsp; Nothing
could be more wild than this narrow winding pass which we
followed for eight miles till we came to the Duke&rsquo;s forest
lodge.&nbsp; Here were waiting for us a most picturesque group in
full Highland dress: the head stalker, the head shepherd, the
kennel keepers with their dogs in leashes, the piper, etc.,
etc.&nbsp; They told us that the Duke had sent up word that we
were coming and he would soon be there himself.</p>
<p>In a few moments he appeared also in full Highland costume
with bare knees, kilt, philibeg, etc.&nbsp; He told us he had
then on these mountains 15,000 head of dear, and thought we might
like to see a <i>start</i>, as it is called.&nbsp; The head
stalker told him, however, that the wind had changed which
affects the scent, and that nothing could be done that day.&nbsp;
The Duke tried to make us amends by making some of his people
sing us Gaelic songs and show us some of the athletic Highland
games.&nbsp; The little lodge he also went over with us, and said
that the Duchess came there and lived six or seven weeks in the
autumn, and that the Duke and Duchess of Buccleuch rented it for
many years while he was a minor.&nbsp; If you could see the tiny
little rooms, you would be astonished to find what the love of
sport can do for these people who possess actual palaces.</p>
<p>After dining again upon salmon and grouse at the pretty little
inn, we took a post chaise to go on to Taymouth, a little village
adjoining Lord Breadalbane&rsquo;s place.&nbsp; We did not arrive
at the inn till after eight and found it completely full. . . .
We were sent to the schoolmaster&rsquo;s to sleep in the smallest
of little rooms, with a great clock which ticked and struck so
loud that we were obliged to silence it, to the great
bewilderment, I dare say, of the scholars the next day.&nbsp;
Before we were in bed, there was a knock at the door, which
proved to be from Lord Breadalbane&rsquo;s butler, to say that he
had been commissioned to enquire whenever we arrived at the inn,
as his Lordship had heard that we were in Scotland and wished us
to make them a visit.</p>
<p>Next morning before we were up came a note from Lord
Breadalbane urging us to come immediately to the Castle. . . .
Taymouth Castle, though not more than fifty years old, has the
air of an old feudal castle. . . . As we were ushered up the
magnificent staircase through first a large antechamber, then
through a superb hall with lofty ceiling glowing with armorial
bearings, and with the most light and delicate carving on every
part of the oaken panelling, then through a long gallery, of
heavier carving filled with fine old cabinets, into the library,
it seemed to me that the whole Castle was one of those magical
delusions that one reads of in Fairy Tales, so strange did it
seem to find such princely magnificence all alone amid such wild
and solitary scenes.&nbsp; I had always the feeling that it would
suddenly vanish, at some wave of an enchanter&rsquo;s wand, as it
must have arisen also.&nbsp; The library is by far the finest
room I ever saw.&nbsp; Its windows and arches and doorways are
all of a fine carved Gothic open work as light as gossamer.&nbsp;
One door which he lately added cost a thousand pounds, the door
alone, not the doorway, so you can judge of the exquisite
workmanship.&nbsp; Here Lady Breadalbane joined us, whom I had
never before met. . . . During dinner the piper in full costume
was playing the pibroch in a gallery outside the window, and
after he had done a band, also in full Highland dress, played
some of the Italian, German as well as Scotch music, at just an
agreeable distance.&nbsp; I have seen nothing in England which
compares in splendor with the state which is kept up here.</p>
<p>We passed Wednesday and Thursday here most agreeably, and we
rode or walked during the whole days.&nbsp; Lord Breadalbane, by
the way, has just been appointed Lord High Chamberlain to the
Queen in place of Lord Spencer.&nbsp; I am glad of this because
we are brought often in contact with the Lord Chamberlain, but it
is very strange to me that a man who lives like a king, and
through whose dominions we travelled a hundred miles from the
German Ocean to the Atlantic, can be Chamberlain to any
Queen.&nbsp; These feudal subordinations we republicans cannot
understand. . . . We stopped at the little town of Oban.&nbsp;
After reading our letters and getting a dinner, we went out just
before sunset for a walk.</p>
<p>We wished much to see the ruins of Dunolly.&nbsp; We passed
the porter&rsquo;s lodge and found ourselves directly in the most
picturesque grounds on the very shore of the ocean and with the
Western Islands lying before us.&nbsp; Mr. Bancroft sent in his
card, which brought out instantly the key to the old castle, and
in a few moments Capt. MacDougal and Mr. Phipps, a brother of
Lord Normanby&rsquo;s, joined us.&nbsp; They pointed out the
interesting points in the landscape, the Castle of Ardtornish,
the scene of Lord of the Isles, etc., in addition to the fine old
ruin we came to see.&nbsp; We lingered till the lighthouses had
begun to glow, and I was reminded very much of the scenery at
Wood&rsquo;s Hole, which I used to enjoy so much, only that could
not boast the association with poetry and feudal romance.&nbsp;
We then went into the house, and found a charming domestic circle
in full evening dress with short sleeves, so that my gray
travelling cloak and straw bonnet were rather out of place.&nbsp;
Here were Mrs. Phipps, and Miss Campbell, her sister, daughters
of Sir Colin Campbell, and to my great delight, Captain MacDougal
brought out the great brooch of Lorn, which his ancestor won from
Bruce and the story of which you will find in the Lord of the
Isles.&nbsp; It fastened the Scotch Plaid, and is larger than a
teacup.&nbsp; He described to me the reverential way in which
Scott took it in both hands when he showed it to him.&nbsp; The
whole evening was pleasant and the more so from being unexpected.
. . . One little thing which adds always to the charm of Scotch
scenery is the dress of the peasantry.&nbsp; One never sees the
real Highland costume, but every shepherd has his plaid slung
over one shoulder, making the most graceful drapery.&nbsp; This,
with the universal Glengarry bonnet, is very pretty.</p>
<p>At Glasgow we intended to pay a visit of a day to the
historian Alison, but found letters announcing Governor
Davis&rsquo;s arrival in London with Mr. Corcoran and immediately
turned our faces homeward.&nbsp; We were to have passed a week on
our return amidst the lakes, and I protested against going back
to London without one look at least.&nbsp; So we stopped at
Kendal on Saturday, took a little carriage over to Windermere and
Ambleside and passed the whole evening with the poet and Mrs.
Wordsworth, at their own exquisite home on Rydal Mount.&nbsp; At
ten o&rsquo;clock we went from there to Miss Martineau, who has
built the prettiest of houses in this valley near to Mrs. Arnold
at Fox Howe.&nbsp; As we had only one day we made an arrangement
with Miss Martineau to go with us and be our guide, and set out
the next day at six o&rsquo;clock and went over to Keswick to
breakfast.&nbsp; From thence we went to Borrowdale, by the side
of Derwentwater, and afterward to Ulswater and home by the fine
pass of Kirkstone.&nbsp; On my return, I found the Duke and
Duchess of Argyle had been to see us.</p>
<p>The time of closing the despatch bag has come and I must hurry
over my delight at the scenery of the lakes.&nbsp; I could have
spent a month there, much to my mind.&nbsp; We arrived home on
Monday and early next morning came Mr. Davis and Mr.
Corcoran.&nbsp; They went to see the Parliament prorogued in
person by the Queen.</p>

December 14, 1848.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Uncle and Aunt</span>: On Friday we
dined at Mr. Tufnell&rsquo;s, who married last spring the
daughter of Lord Rosebery, Lady Anne Primrose, a very &ldquo;nice
person,&rdquo; to use the favorite English term of praise. . . .
Sir John Hobhouse was of our party and he told us so much of
Byron, who was his intimate friend, as you will remember from his
Life, that we stayed much longer than usual at dinner. . . . On
Tuesday we were invited to dine with Miss Coutts, but were
engaged to Mr. Gurney, an immensely rich Quaker banker, brother
of Mrs. Fry.&nbsp; His daughter is married to Ernest Bunsen, the
second son of our friend.&nbsp; We were delighted with the whole
family scene, which was quite unlike anything we have seen in
England.&nbsp; They live at Upton Park, a pretty country seat
about eight miles from us, and are surrounded by their children
and grandchildren.&nbsp; Their costume and language are strictly
Quaker, which was most becoming to Mrs. Gurney&rsquo;s sweet,
placid face. . . . Louis Napoleon&rsquo;s election seems fixed,
and is to me one of the most astounding things of the age.&nbsp;
When we passed several days with him at Mr. Bates&rsquo;s, I
would not have given two straws for his chance of a future
career.&nbsp; To-night Mendelssohn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Elijah&rdquo;
is to be performed, and Jenny Lind sings.&nbsp; We had not been
able to get tickets, which have been sold for five guineas apiece
the last few days.&nbsp; To my great joy Miss Coutts has this
moment written me that she has two for our use, and asks us to
take an early dinner at five with her and accompany her.</p>
<h3><i>To I. P. D.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
June 8, 1849.</p>
<p>I thank you, my dear Uncle, for your pleasant letter, which
contained as usual much that was interesting to me.&nbsp; And so
Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence are to be our successors. . . . Happy as we
have been here, I have a great satisfaction that we are setting
rather than rising; that we have done our work, instead of having
it to do.&nbsp; Like all our pleasures, those here are earned by
fatigue and effort, and I would not willingly live the last three
years over again, or three years like them, though they have
contained high and lasting gratifications.&nbsp; We have
constantly the strongest expressions of regret at our approaching
departure, and in many cases it is, I know, most genuine.&nbsp;
My relations here have been most agreeable, and particularly in
that intellectual circle whose high character and culture have
made their regard most precious to me.&nbsp; The manifestations
of this kindness increase as the time approaches for our going
and we are inundated with invitations of all kinds.</p>
<p>Young Prescott is here.&nbsp; I wish Prescott could have seen
his reception at Lady Lovelace&rsquo;s the other evening when
there happened to be a collection of genius and literature.&nbsp;
What a blessing it is <i>sometimes</i> to a son to have a
father.</p>
<p>To-morrow we dine with Lord John Russell down at Pembroke
Lodge in Richmond Park.&nbsp; On Monday we breakfast with
Macaulay.&nbsp; We met him at dinner this week at Lady
Waldegrave&rsquo;s, and he said: &ldquo;Would you be willing to
breakfast with me some morning, if I asked one or two other
ladies?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Willing!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I
should be delighted beyond measure.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he sent us a
note for Monday next.&nbsp; I depend upon seeing his bachelor
establishment, his library, and mode of life.&nbsp; On Wednesday
we go to a ball at the Palace.&nbsp; But it is useless to go on,
for every day is filled in this way, and gives you an idea of
London in the season.</p>
<h3><i>To I. P. D.</i></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
June 22, 1849.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Uncle</span>: Yesterday I passed
one of the most agreeable days I have had in England at Oxford,
where I went with a party to see Mr. Bancroft take his degree. .
. . Nothing could have gone off better than the whole
thing.&nbsp; Mr. Bancroft went up the day before, but Mrs. Stuart
Mackenzie and her daughter, with Lady Elizabeth Waldegrave,
Louisa, and myself went up yesterday morning and returned at
night.&nbsp; We lunched at the Vice-Chancellor&rsquo;s (where Mr.
B. made a pleasant little informal speech) and were treated with
great kindness by everybody.&nbsp; I wish you could have seen Mr.
Bancroft walking round all day with his scarlet gown and round
velvet cap, such as you see in old Venetian pictures.&nbsp; From
this time forward we shall have the pain of bidding adieu, one by
one, to our friends, as they leave town not to return till we are
gone.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
